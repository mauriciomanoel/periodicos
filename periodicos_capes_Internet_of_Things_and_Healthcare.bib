abstract = "As sensor networks and cloud computation technologies have rapidly developed over recent years, many services and applications integrating these technologies into daily life have come together as an Internet of Things (IoT). At the same time, aging populations have increased the need for expanded and more efficient elderly care services. Fortunately, elderly people can now wear sensing devices which relay data to a personal wireless device, forming a body area network (BAN). These personal wireless devices collect and integrate patients' personal physiological data, and then transmit the data to the backend of the network for related diagnostics. However, a great deal of the information transmitted by such systems is sensitive data, and must therefore be subject to stringent security protocols. Protecting this data from unauthorized access is thus an important issue in IoT-related research. In regard to a cloud healthcare environment, scholars have proposed a secure mechanism to protect sensitive patient information. Their schemes provide a general architecture; however, these previous schemes still have some vulnerability, and thus cannot guarantee complete security. This paper proposes a secure and lightweight body-sensor network based on the Internet of Things for cloud healthcare environments, in order to address the vulnerabilities discovered in previous schemes. The proposed authentication mechanism is applied to a medical reader to provide a more comprehensive architecture while also providing mutual authentication, and guaranteeing data integrity, user untraceability, and forward and backward secrecy, in addition to being resistant to replay attack.",

The purpose of this study is to examine how consumers attain extended use of healthcare wearable devices in the presence of health and privacy concerns. This study empirically tests a novel research model drawing on coping theory and coping model of user adaptation. Data were collected from United States consumers using stratified and random sampling method. The effective sample included 260 responses from consumers. The results indicate that consumers' health and privacy concerns initiate a coping process. Problem-focused and emotion-focused coping efforts significantly predict the extended use of healthcare wearable devices. This study offers several implications for theory and research.

Smart telecommunication technology and the Internet of Things, such as wireless-sensor-network-based smart home healthcare systems (WSN-SHHS) facilitate communication and collaboration among these different roles. <bold>Research problem: </bold> Despite the great potential of such systems to improve the quality and experience, and lower the cost of health care, the technology has not been widely adopted partly due to an inadequate understanding of user expectations, needs, and preferences. This study addresses facilitators and barriers with regard to WSN-SHHS adoption by identifying important sociotechnical, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors. <bold>Research questions:</bold> What are the main facilitators and barriers of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS? How can we contextualize a generic technology adoption model for WSN-SHHS that takes into account unique characteristics of the domain? <bold>Literature review: </bold> We surveyed the literature in WSN-SHHS research and application, technology adoption theories, and the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. We discovered that WSN-SHHS research has focused on technology development but has given little attention to the issue of patients' adoption. <bold>Methodology:</bold> We used a mixed method design that combined an interview and survey over two studies. Participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies in the eastern US. In semistructured interviews, we collected data from 15 home healthcare patients and medical professionals, and analyzed the data using Kvale's approach. In our online- and paper-based surveys, we analyzed the data from 140 respondents using partial least square. <bold>Results and conclusions:</bold> We identified several new constructs in relation to WSN-SHHS adoption, including human detachment concerns, privacy concerns, life-quality expectancy and cost concerns. In addition, we confirmed the constructs from the general adoption model. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, the researchers created a research model. The quantitative study provided empirical support for the model, which has substantial predictive power accounting for more than half of the variance in WSN-SHHS adoption. In particular, our findings reveal that human detachment concerns rather than performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of patients' adoption of WSN-SHHS.",

In the IoT, millions of objects with sensors collect data and send the data to servers that analyze, manage and use the data in order to construct some kinds of smart systems, such as smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare systems and even smart city. It is critical to establish a secure channel between the sensors and servers in order to ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public key infrastructure. These features make our scheme suitable for data transmission in the IoT.",

The proposed scheme consists of (i) a secure and efficient end-user authentication and authorization architecture based on the certificate based DTLS handshake, (ii) secure end-to-end communication based on session resumption, and (iii) robust mobility based on interconnected smart gateways. The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS. Analysis of our implementation revealed that the handover latency caused by mobility is low and the handover process does not incur any processing or communication overhead on the sensors.",

IoT enables network connectivity between smart devices at all times, everywhere, and about everything. In this context, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play an important role in increasing the ubiquity of networks with smart devices that are low-cost and easy to deploy. However, sensor nodes are restricted in terms of energy, processing and memory. Additionally, low-power radios are very sensitive to noise, interference and multipath distortions. In this context, this article proposes a routing protocol based on Routing by Energy and Link quality (REL) for IoT applications. To increase reliability and energy-efficiency, REL selects routes on the basis of a proposed end-to-end link quality estimator mechanism, residual energy and hop count. Furthermore, REL proposes an event-driven mechanism to provide load balancing and avoid the premature energy depletion of nodes/networks. Performance evaluations were carried out using simulation and testbed experiments to show the impact and benefits of REL in small and large-scale networks. The results show that REL increases the network lifetime and services availability, as well as the quality of service of IoT applications. It also provides an even distribution of scarce network resources and reduces the packet loss rate, compared with the performance of well-known protocols.",

To achieve its purposes, telemedicine utilizes a number of wireless technologies as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is redefining the capacity of telemedicine in terms of improved and seamless healthcare services. In this regard, this paper contributes to the set of features of telemedicine by proposing a model for an IoT-based health prescription assistant (HPA), which helps each patient to follow the doctors recommendations properly. This paper also designs a security system that ensures user authentication and protected access to resources and services. The security system authenticates a user based on the OpenID standard. An access control mechanism is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to medical devices. Once the authentication is successful, the user is issued an authorization ticket, which this paper calls a security access token (SAT). The SAT contains a set of privileges that grants the user access to medical IoT devices and their services and/or resources. The SAT is cryptographically protected to guard against forgery. A medical IoT device verifies the SAT prior to serving a request, and thus, ensures protected access. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented to experimentally analyze and compare the resource efficiency of different SAT verification approaches in terms of a number of performance metrics, including computation and communication overhead.",

Frailty of old age, susceptibility to diseases, and impairments are inevitable issues that these senior adults need to deal with in daily life. Recently, there has been an increasing demand on developing elderly care services utilizing novel technologies, with the aim of providing independent living. Internet of things (IoT), as an advanced paradigm to connect physical and virtual things for enhanced services, has been introduced that can provide significant improvements in remote elderly monitoring. Several efforts have been recently devoted to address elderly care requirements utilizing IoT-based systems. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of user-centered study from an all-inclusive perspective for investigating the daily needs of senior adults. In this paper, we study the IoT-enabled systems tackling elderly monitoring to categorize the existing approaches from a new perspective and to introduce a hierarchical model for elderly-centered monitoring. We investigate the existing approaches by considering the elderly requirements at the center of the attention. In addition, we evaluate the main objectives and trends in IoT-based elderly monitoring systems in order to pave the way for future systems to improve the quality of elderly’s life.",

abstract = "Objectives A number of technologies can reduce overall costs for the prevention or management of chronic illnesses. These include devices that constantly monitor health indicators, devices that auto-administer therapies, or devices that track real-time health data when a patient self-administers a therapy. Because they have increased access to high-speed Internet and smartphones, many patients have started to use mobile applications (apps) to manage various health needs. These devices and mobile apps are now increasingly used and integrated with telemedicine and telehealth via the medical Internet of Things (mIoT). This paper reviews mIoT and big data in healthcare fields. Methods mIoT is a critical piece of the digital transformation of healthcare, as it allows new business models to emerge and enables changes in work processes, productivity improvements, cost containment and enhanced customer experiences. Results Wearables and mobile apps today support fitness, health education, symptom tracking, and collaborative disease management and care coordination. All those platform analytics can raise the relevancy of data interpretations, reducing the amount of time that end users spend piecing together data outputs. Insights gained from big data analysis will drive the digital disruption of the healthcare world, business processes and real-time decision-making. Conclusions A new category of {"}personalised preventative health coaches{"} (Digital Health Advisors) will emerge. These workers will possess the skills and the ability to interpret and understand health and well-being data. They will help their clients avoid chronic and diet-related illness, improve cognitive function, achieve improved mental health and achieve improved lifestyles overall. As the global population ages, such roles will become increasingly important.",

These services require timely and accurate event delivery, but such in-situ deployments are often limited by the coverage of sensing/communication infrastructures. In this paper we develop effective, scalable, and realistic data collection and upload solutions using mobile data collectors in community IoT systems. Specifically, we address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine the optimal schedule for communication to enable timely data delivery under dynamicity in network connectivity, data characteristics/heterogeneity, and mobility. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies, where an initial upload plan is generated offline with prior knowledge of networks and data, and a subsequent runtime adaptation alters the plan under multiple dynamics. To validate our approach, we designed and built SCALECycle, our mobile data collection platform, and deployed it in real communities in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA. Measurements from these testbeds are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental results indicate that compared with opportunistic operation, our two-phase approach using a judicious combination of policies can result in 30%–60% improvement in overall data utility, 30% reduction in collection delays, along with greater resilience to dynamicity and improved scalability.",

However, there is no clear approach to modeling these systems and envisioning their capabilities at the design time. Therefore, the process of designing these systems is ad hoc and its real impact is evaluated once the solution is already implemented, which is risky and expensive. This paper proposes a modeling approach that uses human-centric wireless sensor networks to specify and evaluate models of IoT-based systems at the time of design, avoiding the need to spend time and effort on early implementations of immature designs. It allows designers to focus on the system design, leaving the implementation decisions for a next phase.

The case study used in the proposal evaluation is based on a real train crash.

They include healthcare monitoring, industrial application, smart grid, home automation, and many energy-critical application suffered from limited resources. In response, many studies have proposed energy efficient solutions, however, they may waste energy as ever. It is because they do not consider the contentions in multi-coordinator environments then the frequent packet collisions are followed by retransmission which consumed unnecessary energy. In this respect, we proposed a new and simply implementable contention mitigation scheme to enhance the energy efficiency of sensor nodes by reducing the contention degree among neighboring coordinators. In the proposed scheme, the coordinators recognize the network state by exchanging their information with each other. It leads that the coordinators isolate the superframe duration by staggering own beacon transmission. It can alleviate significant contentions among burst packets at the beginning of the superframe. Therefore, the proposed scheme reduces a lot of unnecessary wasted energy in the process of redundant retransmission. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing energy efficient solutions with regard to the network performance.",

Since IoT consists of various heterogeneous devices that exhibit different traffic patterns and expect different quality of service (QoS) in terms of data rate, bit error rate and the stability index of the channel, therefore, in this paper, we formulated an optimization problem to assign channels to heterogeneous IoT devices within a smart building for the provisioning of their desired QoS. To solve this problem, a novel particle swarm optimization-based algorithm is proposed. Then, exhaustive simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the supremacy of our proposed algorithm over the existing ones in terms of throughput, bit error rate and the stability index of the channel.",

Also, the proposed G-CP-ABE framework merges symmetric encryption and CP-ABE scheme to minimize the overall encryption time.

@misc{MajidAlOtaibi2010TAAi,
abstract = "Mobile and wireless technologies have enabled the first step of pervasive communication systems and applications with billions terminals in commercial operation in the world. Yet this is only the beginning as wireless technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) are drawn with a potential use tens of billions of tags and a virtually unlimited range of applications considered. RFID is a contactless, without line-of-sight, low-power and low-cost wireless communication technology that provides automatic identification and data collection. Behind the technological aspects of RFID, it is expected to have a long lasting impact on our society. RFID technology is applied in many fields such as in logistics, supply chain, transportation, manufacturing, distribution, retail, healthcare, agriculture, construction, safety, security, law enforcement, intellectual property protection and many other areas. It is envisioned that RFID will tag billions of objects which can over wireless connections report their location, identity, and history hence becoming the “Internet of Things”[1]. RFID systems contain a number of tags with unique serial numbers, a reader to communicate and collect information from the tags, and an application processor. A RFID reader identifies a tag attached to an object through RF wireless communications. The tag sends its own ID and additional information to the reader for tag identification. The reader should be able to recognize tags as quickly as possible. However, the signals in both directions between the reader and the tag may collide because communication is performed over a shared wireless channel. As a consequence, either the reader may not identify all tags or the tag identification process may be delayed. Thus, anti-collision algorithms which provide quick and correct recognition regardless of the occurrence of collisions are required. There are three main groups of tag anti-collision algorithms: ALOHA based, Tree based and Hybrid algorithms. ALOHA based methods reduce the occurrence of collisions by providing tags the opportunity to select a random transmission time (a slot or frame). Tree based methods reduce collisions with the reader by splitting the tags based on their identification number (ID). Hybrid algorithms combine the characteristics of both ALOHA and Tree based algorithms. Estimating number of tags in the interrogation zone of the reader is essential in most of ALOHA based and hybrid algorithms as the throughput efficiency of the system can be maximized when the number of available slots is set equal to the number of remaining tags. Most existing methods estimate the number of tags in the interrogation zone based on the collision information of the previous round. xii Although ALOHA based tag anti-collision algorithms are simple to implement and fast, they have a problem that a specific tag may not be identified for a long time and this is called tag starvation. That means ALOHA based algorithms cannot completely avoid collisions. For more improvement, finding an accurate method to estimate the number of presented tags in the interrogation zone of the reader is the most important field of research. The algorithms can be further improved by restricting the number of responding tags, when there are a high number of tags present in the interrogation zone. The tree based RFID tag anti-collision algorithms achieve full read rate, however, the efficiency of the identification process can be affected by the length and distribution of tag IDs, and the tag population size. Thus, tree based algorithms suffers from the long identification delay. Hybrid algorithms combine the advantages of both ALOHA and tree based methods, thereby mitigating tag starvation and long delay. As such, these algorithms are most promising and substantial research has been reported on their development and applications last years. This thesis introduces the Signal Strength (SS) based estimation technique which shows better performance compared to other estimation methods. The new method uses the information of which bits collided in each slot as well as the total received signal strength of each collision. For different encoding schemes the information available in the signal strength of collisions can differ, and therefore a comprehensive analysis of signal strength based tag estimation for encoding methods used in RFID systems is presented in this thesis. Several encoding schemes, including commercially used FM0 and Manchester benefit from SS estimation. Among these, Manchester encoding has been found to provide best improvement in the performance. Two anti-collision algorithms are improved by applying SS estimation technique in this thesis. They are Dynamic Frame Slotted ALOHA with SS (DFSA-SS) and improved Query Tree ALOHA with SS estimation technique (iQTA-SSx) algorithms. The time efficiencies of DFSA-SS and iQTA-SSx are 67.5% and 82% respectively. These performances exceed best time efficiency of DFSA and QT-ALOHA algorithms, which are 66.5% and 62% respectively. For large number of tags, the optimum frame size for DFSA and DFSA-SS becomes too large for practical implementation and therefore iQTA-SSx becomes the appropriate choice. Both algorithms work with existing standards and can be implemented within the reader thus no modifications to tags are needed. Analysis of the implementation aspects is performed for these improved algorithms. One of the main implementation aspects involves using a reduced number of bits for capturing signal strength data. Fewer bits allow cheaper Analogue to Digital Converters (ADCs) to be used. The simulation results show that performance of DFSA-SS and iQTA-SSx algorithms is preserved even if 7 bit ADC resolution is used instead of floating point representation. The reading range is highly related xiii to the SNR level of each tag‟s signal at the reader. For a system with a reading range of 10 m radius, 7 bits ADC resolution and -70 dBm noise, the estimation performance drops to 64.3% and 76% for DFSA-SS and iQTA-SSx respectively. In the experiments the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) hardware using the open source GNU radio stack was used to analyse the message exchange between the reader and tags showing that SS based estimation technique works in practice.",

abstract = "Ichnology straddles the boundary between palaeontology and sedimentology, and is becoming an increasingly important tool in both fields. For the palaeontologist, trace fossils allow insight into behaviour and biomechanics of animals that would otherwise be the subject of conjecture. For the sedimentologist, trace fossils have a marked impact on the interpretation of sedimentary rocks in that they destroy primary sedimentary structures, but can also reveal subtle palaeoenvironmental information beyond the resolution attainable by analysis of primary physical sedimentary structures. This contribution aims to review the major developments in the field of ichnology, and to highlight some of the tools and approaches currently used by ichnologists. A personal ethos for the study of trace fossils in core is outlined as a model ichnological protocol, and some of the frontiers of the science as a whole are briefly discussed.",

abstract = "Recently, the significance of internet of things (IoT) is rapidly growing in the next generation of information and communication technology due to rapid advances in wireless communication technologies which have triggered the development of low-power, reliable and miniaturized devices. These advances lead to the creation of IoT ecosystem that enables development of various services. Especially, there are a number of attempts to apply communication technology of IoT in the field of healthcare services which deals with medical applications such as a remote medical treatment. In IoT-based healthcare system, in general, a number of medical devices are densely deployed in narrow area. Therefore, they are exposed to signal interference among them which causes significant performance degradation. In this paper, we present an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)-based network interface and channel selection algorithm for multi-channel MAC protocols in IoT ecosystem that take into account a multitude of decision factors, such as expected channel condition, latency and frame reception ratio. The proposed scheme can provide flexibility for various requirements of different medical services through performing AHP. In particular, the proposed scheme considers IoT-based healthcare system because it is the most complex scenario of fundamental IoT applications. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive simulations, and the simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm provides low latency and high reliability.",

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson&#x0027;s disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient&#x0027;s clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological revolution that is rapidly reshaping our society with ubiquitous sensing devices. As more sensors are being deployed, the amount of data collected is also growing significantly, leading to the increasingly important role of data mining in the IoT. One specific type of data frequently captured by sensors in the context of the IoT is trajectory data, which has attracted considerable attention lately. Various types of trajectory data have become available, such as user check-ins, vehicle GPS traces and human activity profiles recorded by smart phones. As trajectories can be generated by a large variety of sensors, many challenges arise in different application scenarios in the IoT that are associated with trajectory data mining. In this thesis, we address three trajectory data mining challenges in three different application scenarios of the IoT, namely, community, transport and healthcare applications. The first challenge is in social and community applications. The check-ins and geo-tagged photos submitted by a user on a social networking site can be regarded as trajectories that reflect the popularity of the points-of-interest (POI) being visited and the personal preference of the user. This data can be used to recommend trips to a tourist. However, the challenge of trip recommendation not only lies in searching for relevant POIs to form a personalised trip, but also selecting the best time of day to visit the POIs. Popular POIs can be too crowded during peak times, resulting in long queues and delays. To improve the quality of the solution of automated trip recommendation, we propose the Personalised Crowd-aware Trip Recommendation (PersCT) algorithm to recommend personalised trips that also avoid the most crowded times of the POIs using trajectories and pedestrian sensing data. Our results on a real-life dataset show that it is possible to achieve a balance between conflicting objectives in trip recommendation, such as satisfying user interests while reducing the crowdedness of the trips. The second challenge is in transport applications. Despite the recent introduction of advanced technologies such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), traffic congestion remains a major challenge to urban designers and transport authorities. Current ITS technologies usually employ induction loop sensors or street cameras to monitor the traffic conditions. However, monitoring the change in the traffic flows as a result of external events can be difficult. Therefore, we propose a framework to analyse changes in traffic flows due to road closure events based on GPS trajectory data. We employ ideas from contrast mining and frequent itemset mining to define, characterise and visualise the changes. The effectiveness and robustness of this framework are shown by three experiments using real taxi trajectories as well as traffic simulations in two different cities. The third challenge is in healthcare applications. The increasing health care cost has motivated the development of remote health monitoring. Home-based rehabilitation from conditions such as stroke is usually unmonitored and the progress of recovery is difficult to assess. Typically, a patient routinely revisits the hospital to seek feedback on the rehabilitation progress, which is costly and inefficient. The use of wearable sensors to capture limb movement information can be a cost-efficient alternative to frequent hospital revisits. In this context, one important problem of interest is to recognise specific actions performed by the person in daily life so that a physician can easily observe the patient’s movement from the continuous data stream sent by the sensors. We propose the use of a 3D trajectory reconstruction algorithm to process the raw sensor data and extract trajectory features that can improve action recognition accuracy. We also propose a clustering-based classifier for use with the trajectory features, and show that our proposed approach out-performs several benchmark classifiers in recognition accuracy. We conclude this thesis by presenting a number of future research directions that may be promising for trajectory mining in the IoT.",

Using the model, we analyze the synergistic effect of the functional requirements (data collection from the human body and transferring it to the top level) and non-functional requirements (trade-offs between energy-security-environmental factors, treated as Quality-of-Service (QoS)). We use feature models to represent the requirements at the earliest stage for the analysis and describe a model-driven methodology to design the possible BAN applications. Firstly, we specify the requirements as the problem domain (PD) variability model for the BAN applications. Next, we introduce the generative technology (meta-programming as the solution domain (SD)) and the mapping procedure to map the PD feature-based variability model onto the SD feature model. Finally, we create an executable meta-specification that represents the BAN functionality to describe the variability of the problem domain though transformations. The meta-specification (along with the meta-language processor) is a software generator for multiple BAN-oriented applications. We validate the methodology with experiments and a case study to generate a family of programs for the BAN sensor controllers. This enables to obtain the adequate measure of QoS efficiently through the interactive adjustment of the meta-parameter values and re-generation process for the concrete BAN application.</p>",

This paper describes the design and implementation of a situated clinical decision support (SCDSS) system, most appropriate for smart cities. The SCDSS was prototyped and enhanced in a clinic. The SCDSS was then used in a clinic as well as in a university hospital centre. In this article, the system’s architecture, subcomponents and integrated workflow are described. The systems’ design was the result of a knowledge acquisition process involving interviews with five specialists and testing with 50 patients. The reports (specialist consultation report) generated by the SCDSS were shown to general practitioners who were not able to distinguish them from human specialist reports. We propose a context-aware CDSS and assess its effectiveness in managing a wide medical range of patients. Five different patient cases were identified for analysis. The SCDSS was used to produce draft electronic specialist consultations, which were then compared to the original specialists’ consultations. It was found that the SCDSS-generated consults were of better quality for a number of reasons discussed herein. SCDSSs have great promise for their use in the clinical environment of smart cities. Valuable insights into the integration and use of situated clinical decision support systems are highlighted and suggestions for future research are given.</p>",

This amalgamation of WBAN-based healthcare systems to cloud-based healthcare systems gave rise to serious privacy concerns to the sensitive healthcare data. Hence, there is a need for the proactive identification and effective mitigation mechanisms for these patient’s data privacy concerns that pose continuous threats to the integrity and stability of the healthcare environment. For this purpose, a systematic literature review has been conducted that presents a clear picture of the privacy concerns of patient’s data in cloud-assisted healthcare systems and analyzed the mechanisms that are recently proposed by the research community. The methodology used for conducting the review was based on Kitchenham guidelines. Results from the review show that most of the patient’s data privacy techniques do not fully address the privacy concerns and therefore require more efforts. The summary presented in this paper would help in setting research directions for the techniques and mechanisms that are needed to address the patient’s data privacy concerns in a balanced and light-weight manner by considering all the aspects and limitations of the cloud-assisted healthcare systems.",

BackgroundExtensive deployment and sustainability of integrated care services (ICS) constitute an unmet need to reduce the burden of chronic conditions. The European Union project NEXES (2008–2013) assessed the deployment of four ICS encompassing the spectrum of severity of chronic patients. ObjectiveThe current study aims to (i) describe the open source Adaptive Case Management (ACM) system (Linkcare®) developed to support the deployment of ICS at the level of healthcare district; (ii) to evaluate its performance; and, (iii) to identify key challenges for regional deployment of ICS. MethodsWe first defined a conceptual model for ICS management and execution composed of five main stages. We then specified an associated logical model considering the dynamic runtime of ACM. Finally, we implemented the four ICS as a physical model with an ICS editor to allow professionals (case managers) to play active roles in adapting the system to their needs. Instances of ICS were then run in Linkcare®. Four ICS provided a framework for evaluating the system: Wellness and Rehabilitation (W&R) (number of patients enrolled in the study (n)=173); Enhanced Care (EC) in frail chronic patients to prevent hospital admissions, (n=848); Home Hospitalization and Early Discharge (HH/ED) (n=2314); and, Support to remote diagnosis (Support) (n=7793). The method for assessment of telemedicine applications (MAST) was used for iterative evaluation. ResultsLinkcare® supports ACM with shared-care plans across healthcare tiers and offers integration with provider-specific electronic health records. Linkcare® successfully contributed to the deployment of the four ICS: W&R facilitated long-term sustainability of training effects (p<0.01) and active life style (p<0.03); EC showed significant positive outcomes (p<0.05); HH/ED reduced on average 5 in-hospital days per patient with a 30-d re-admission rate of 10%; and, Support, enhanced community-based quality forced spirometry testing (p<0.01). Key challenges for regional deployment of personalized care were identified. ConclusionsLinkcare® provided the required functionalities to support integrated care adopting an ACM model, and it showed adaptive potential for its implementation in different health scenarios. The research generated strategies that contributed to face the challenges of the transition toward personalized medicine for chronic patients.",

Use of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based body area networks (BANs) is increasing for continuous monitoring and medical healthcare in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies. However, in the case of monitoring the health of all citizens or people in a country, the millions of sensors attached to human bodies generate massive volume of heterogeneous data, called “Big Data.” Processing Big Data and performing real-time actions in critical situations is a challenging task. Therefore, in order to address such issues, we propose a Real-time Medical Emergency Response System that involves IoT-based medical sensors deployed on the human body. Moreover, the proposed system consists of the data analysis building, called “Intelligent Building,” depicted by the proposed layered architecture and implementation model, and it is responsible for analysis and decision-making. The data collected from millions of body-attached sensors is forwarded to Intelligent Building for processing and for performing necessary actions using various units such as collection, Hadoop Processing (HPU), and analysis and decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are evaluated by implementing the system on Hadoop using an UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine. Various medical sensory datasets and real-time network traffic are considered for evaluating the efficiency of the system. The results show that the proposed system has the capability of efficiently processing WBAN sensory data from millions of users in order to perform real-time responses in case of emergencies.",

Although, there is a close relationship among the discovery, selection and composition tasks of Web services, research community has treated these challenges at individual level rather to focus on them collectively for developing efficient solution, which is the purpose of this work. This paper aims to propose an approach to integrate the service discovery, selection and composition of Semantic Web services on runtime basis. Design/methodology/approach The proposed approach defined as a quality of service (QoS)-aware approach is based on QoS model to perform discovery, selection and composition tasks at runtime to enhance the user satisfaction and quality guarantee by incorporating non-functional parameters such as response time and throughput with the Web services and user request. In this paper, the proposed approach is based on ontology for semantic description of Web services, which provides interoperability and automation in the Web services tasks. Findings This work proposed an integrated framework of Web service discovery, selection and composition which supports end user to search, select and compose the Web services at runtime using semantic description and non-functional requirements. The proposed approach is evaluated by various data sets from the Web Service Challenge 2009 (WSC-2009) to show the efficiency of this work.

Typically, the functionality of the systems is predefined by the patient’s data collected using sensor networks along with medical instrumentation; then, the data is transferred through the Internet for treatment and decision-making. Therefore, systems creation is indeed challenging.

The framework contains a multi-layered structure with feature-based modeling and feature model transformations at the top and the application software generation at the bottom. We have validated the framework using available tools and developed an experimental PHM to test some aspects of the functionality of the reference architecture in real time.

Nowadays, the IoT has been used widely and commonly by a variety of domains, such as transportation and logistics domain and healthcare domain. However, missing values are very common in the IoT for a variety of reasons, which results in the fact that the experimental data are incomplete. As a result of this, some work, which is related to the data of the IoT, can't be carried out normally. And it leads to the reduction in the accuracy and reliability of the data analysis results. This paper, for the characteristics of the data itself and the features of missing data in IoT, divides the missing data into three types and defines three corresponding missing value imputation problems. Then, we propose three new models to solve the corresponding problems, and they are model of missing value imputation based on context and linear mean (MCL), model of missing value imputation based on binary search (MBS), and model of missing value imputation based on Gaussian mixture model (MGI). Experimental results showed that the three models can improve the accuracy, reliability, and stability of missing value imputation greatly and effectively.",

However, the further flourishing of e-/m-healthcare still faces many challenges including information security and privacy preservation. To address these problems, a healthcare system (HES) framework is designed that collects medical data from WBANs, transmits them through an extensive wireless sensor network infrastructure, and finally, publishes them into wireless personal-area networks via a gateway. Furthermore, HES involves the groups of send&#x2013;receive model scheme to realize key distribution and secure data transmission, the homomorphic encryption based on matrix scheme to ensure privacy, and an expert system able to analyze the scrambled medical data and feedback the results automatically. Theoretical and experimental evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the security, privacy, and improved performance of HES compared with current systems or schemes. Finally, the prototype implementation of HES is explored to verify its feasibility.",

Chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.",

In a multi-method study that includes conceptual research and qualitative data from in-depth interviews, we conceptualize “smart service” and “smart service systems” based on using smart products as boundary objects that integrate service consumers’ and service providers’ resources and activities. Smart products allow both actors to retrieve and to analyze aggregated field evidence and to adapt service systems based on contextual data.

Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.",

While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, &#x201C;big data,&#x201D; and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.",

In these applications, various devices can be identified using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags, which can be used for transferring the collected data to other local or remote objects at various geographical locations. However, for automatic reading of data accumulated in an RFID-tag embedded in an object/device, authentication is required at various stages for the aforementioned applications. In RFID-based systems for smart applications, an RFID-tag may be operated from several meters distance and it does not require to be put within direct line-of-sight of the reader like a barcode system. Therefore, the traditional barcode system will be replaced by the RFID authentication system in near future since in the later, technology reading of a large amount of data within short span is possible. However, in existing RFID-based authentication systems, an adversary may access the RFID-tag information, which can compromise the privacy and it may also create forgery problems. In addition, RFID-based authentication is suffering from heavy computation burden since an RFID-tag has very limited computation capability. To address these issues, lots of anonymous RFID-based authentication schemes have been designed using lightweight cryptographic tools, e.g., the hash function and symmetric key encryption. However, all these schemes failed to achieve known security and functionality requirements. Motivated by the above-mentioned issues, in this paper, we have put forwarded an RFID-based authentication architecture for distributed IoT (Internet of Things) applications suitable for the future smart city environments. Subsequently, we have put forwarded a lightweight RFID-based authentication scheme to provide reasonable execution time compared to existing schemes.

This wealth of information requires efficient methods of classification and analysis where deep learning is a promising technique for large-scale data analytics. While deep learning has been successful in implementations that utilize high-performance computing platforms, its use on low-power wearable devices is limited by resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology, which combines features learned from inertial sensor data together with complementary information from a set of shallow features to enable accurate and real-time activity classification. The design of this combined method aims to overcome some of the limitations present in a typical deep learning framework where on-node computation is required. To optimize the proposed method for real-time on-node computation, spectral domain preprocessing is used before the data are passed onto the deep learning framework. The classification accuracy of our proposed deep learning approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using both laboratory and real world activity datasets. Our results show the validity of the approach on different human activity datasets, outperforming other methods, including the two methods used within our combined pipeline. We also demonstrate that the computation times for the proposed method are consistent with the constraints of real-time on-node processing on smartphones and a wearable sensor platform.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) networks are the pillar of recent novel scenarios, such as smart cities or e-healthcare applications. Among other challenges, these networks cover the deployment and interaction of small devices with constrained capabilities and Internet protocol (IP)-based networking connectivity. These constrained devices usually require connection to the Internet to exchange information (e.g., management or sensing data) or access network services. However, only authenticated and authorized devices can, in general, establish this connection. The so-called authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) services are in charge of performing these tasks on the Internet. Thus, it is necessary to deploy protocols that allow constrained devices to verify their credentials against AAA infrastructures. The Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) has been standardized by the Internet engineering task force (IETF) to carry the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which provides flexible authentication upon the presence of AAA. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first deep study of the feasibility of EAP/PANA for network access control in constrained devices. We provide light-weight versions and implementations of these protocols to fit them into constrained devices. These versions have been designed to reduce the impact in standard specifications. The goal of this work is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of EAP/PANA in IoT devices; (2) to provide the scientific community with the first light-weight interoperable implementation of EAP/PANA for constrained devices in the Contiki operating system (Contiki OS), called PANATIKI.

abstract = "The development of internet of things and the related sensor technology have been a key driving force for the rapid development of industry and information technology. The requirement of wireless, sustainable and independent operation is becoming increasingly important for sensor networks that currently could include thousands even to millions of sensor nodes with different functionalities. For these purposes, developing technologies of self-powered sensors that can utilize the ambient environmental energy to drive the operation themselves is highly desirable and mandatory. The realization of self-powered sensors generally has two approaches: the first approach is to develop environmental energy harvesting devices for driving the traditional sensors; the other is to develop a new category of sensors – self-powered active sensors – that can actively generate electrical signal itself as a response to a stimulation/triggering from the ambient environment. The recent invention and intensive development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as a new technology for mechanical energy harvesting can be utilized as self-powered active mechanical sensors, because the parameters (magnitude, frequency, number of periods, etc.) of the generated electrical signal are directly determined by input mechanical behaviors. In this review paper, we first briefly introduce the fundamentals of TENGs, including the four basic working modes. Then, the most updated progress of developing TENGs as self-powered active sensors is reviewed. TENGs with different working modes and rationally designed structures have been developed as self-powered active sensors for a variety of mechanical motions, including pressure change, physical touching, vibrations, acoustic waves, linear displacement, rotation, tracking of moving objects, and acceleration detection. Through combining the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current, the detection of both static and dynamic processes has been enabled. The integration of individual sensor elements into arrays or matrixes helps to realize the mapping or parallel detection for multiple points. On the other hand, the relationship between the amplitude of TENG-generated electrical signal and the chemical state of its triboelectric surface enables TENGs to function as self-powered active chemical sensors. Through continuous research on the TENG-based self-powered active sensors in the coming years to further improve the sensitivity and realize the self-powered operation for the entire sensor node systems, they will soon have broad applications in touch screens, electronic skins, healthcare, environmental/infrastructure monitoring, national security, and more. •The fundamental of triboelectric nanogenerators as the basis of serving as self-powered active sensors.•Triboelectric-nanogenerator-based self-powered active sensors for different types of mechanical motions, chemical detection and environmental monitoring.•An insightful perspective for the future research.",

Vishvakarma (1) Keywords: object detection; object tracking; quadtree; macroblock resizing; monocular camera; directional vector pixel Abstract: In this paper, a high speed, reliable, low memory demanding and precise object detection and tracking algorithm is proposed. The proposed work uses a macroblock of rectangular shape, which is placed in the very first frame of the video to detect and track a single moving object using monocular camera. The macroblocks are positioned in the field of view (FOV) of camera where the probability of occurrence of object is high. After placing macroblocks, a threshold value is examined to detect the presence of objects in the selected macroblocks. Afterwards, a quadtree approach is used to minimize the bounding box and to reduce the pixelation. A tracking algorithm is proposed which illustrates a unique method to find the moving directional vectors. The proposed method is based on macroblock resizing, which demonstrates an accuracy rate of 98.5% with low memory utilization.

abstract = "The needs for efficient and scalable community health awareness model become a crucial issue in today’s health care applications. Many health care service providers need to provide their services for long terms, in real time and interactively. Many of these applications are based on the emerging Wireless Body Area networks (WBANs) technology. WBANs have developed as an effective solution for a wide range of healthcare, military, sports, general health and social applications. On the other hand, handling data in a large scale (currently known as Big Data) requires an efficient collection and processing model with scalable computing and storage capacity. Therefore, a new computing paradigm is needed such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we present a novel cloud supported model for efficient community health awareness in the presence of a large scale WBANs data generation. The objective is to process this big data in order to detect the abnormal data using MapReduce infrastructure and user defined functions with minimum processing delay. The goal is to have a large monitored data of WBANs to be available to the end user or to the decision maker in reliable manner. While reducing data packet processing energy, the proposed work is minimizing the data processing delay by choosing cloudlet or local cloud model and MapReduce infrastructure. So, the overall delay is minimized, thus leading to detect the abnormal data in the cloud in real time mode. In this paper we present a multi-layer computing model composed of Local Cloud (LC) layer and Enterprise Cloud (EP) layer that aim to process the collected data from Monitored Subjects (MSs) in a large scale to generate useful facts, observations or to find abnormal phenomena within the monitored data. Performance results show that integrating the MapReduce capabilities with cloud computing model will reduce the processing delay. The proposed MapReduce infrastructure has also been applied in lower layer, such as LC in order to reduce the amount of communications and processing delay. Performance results show that applying MapReduce infrastructure in lower tire will significantly decrease the overall processing delay.",

Firstly, a nonlinear Markov process is derived from a large number of big networks with weak interactions, where each big network is described as a continuous-time block-structured Markov process. Secondly, some effective algorithms are given for computing the fixed points of the nonlinear Markov process by means of the UL-type RG-factorization. Finally, the Birkhoff center, the locally stable fixed points, the Lyapunov functions and the relative entropy are developed to analyze stability or metastability of the system of weakly interacting big networks, and several interesting open problems are proposed with detailed interpretation.

With advancements in healthcare technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for ultra-dense, ultra-low-power memory is increasing. In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on the most notable approaches to the fabrication of physically flexible memory devices. With the future goal of replacing traditional mechanical hard disks with solid-state storage devices, a fully flexible electronic system will need two basic devices: transistors and nonvolatile memory. Transistors are used for logic operations and gating memory arrays, while nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices are required for storing information in the main memory and cache storage. Since the highest density of transistors and storage structures is manifested in memories, the focus of this review is flexible NVM. Flexible NVM components are discussed in terms of their functionality, performance metrics, and reliability aspects, all of which are critical components for NVM technology to be part of mainstream consumer electronics, IoT, and advanced healthcare devices. Finally, flexible NVMs are benchmarked and future prospects are provided.",

Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers’ data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework’s architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework’s design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.",

abstract = "Indoor localisation technologies are a core component of Smart Homes. Many applications within Smart Homes benefit from localisation technologies to determine the locations of things, objects and people. The tremendous characteristics of the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems have become one of the enabler technologies in the Internet of Things (IOT) that connect objects and things wirelessly. RFID is a promising technology in indoor positioning that not only uniquely identifies entities but also locates affixed RFID tags on objects or subjects in stationary and real-time. The rapid advancement in RFID-based systems has sparked the interest of researchers in Smart Homes to employ RFID technologies and potentials to assist with optimising (non-) pervasive healthcare systems in automated homes. In this research localisation techniques and enabled positioning sensors are investigated. Passive RFID sensors are used to localise passive tags that are affixed to Smart Home objects and track the movement of individuals in stationary and real-time settings. In this study, we develop an affordable passive localisation platform using inexpensive passive RFID sensors. To fillful this aim, a passive localisation framework using minimum tracking resources (RFID sensors) has been designed. A localisation prototype and localisation application that examined the affixed RFID tag on objects to evaluate our proposed locaisation framework was then developed. Localising algorithms were utilised to achieve enhanced accuracy of localising one particular passive tag which that affixed to target objects. This thesis uses a general enough approach so that it could be applied more widely to other applications in addition to Health Smart Homes. A passive RFID localising framework is designed and developed through systematic procedures. A localising platform is built to test the proposed framework, along with developing a RFID tracking application using Java programming language and further data analysis in MATLAB. This project applies localisation procedures and evaluates them experimentally. The experimental study positively confirms that our proposed localisation framework is capable of enhancing the accuracy of the location of the tracked individual. The low-cost design uses only one passive RFID target tag, one RFID reader and three to four antennas.",

abstract = "<p><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a worldwide network of interconnected things that are uniquely addressable, via standard communication protocols. The use of IoT for continuous monitoring of public health is being rapidly adopted by various countries while generating a massive volume of heterogeneous, multisource, dynamic, and sparse high-velocity data. Handling such an enormous amount of high-speed medical data while integrating, collecting, processing, analyzing, and extracting knowledge constitutes a challenging task. On the other hand, most of the existing IoT devices do not cooperate with one another by using the same medium of communication. For this reason, it is a challenging task to develop healthcare applications for IoT that fulfill all user needs through real-time monitoring of health parameters. Therefore, to address such issues, this article proposed a Hadoop-based intelligent care system (HICS) that demonstrates IoT-based collaborative contextual Big Data sharing among all of the devices in a healthcare system. In particular, the proposed system involves a network architecture with enhanced processing features for data collection generated by millions of connected devices. In the proposed system, various sensors, such as wearable devices, are attached to the human body and measure health parameters and transmit them to a primary mobile device (PMD). The collected data are then forwarded to intelligent building (IB) using the Internet where the data are thoroughly analyzed to identify abnormal and serious health conditions. Intelligent building consists of (1) a Big Data collection unit (used for data collection, filtration, and load balancing); (2) a Hadoop processing unit (HPU) (composed of Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and MapReduce); and (3) an analysis and decision unit. The HPU, analysis, and decision unit are equipped with a medical expert system, which reads the sensor data and performs actions in the case of an emergency situation. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, we use publicly available medical sensory datasets and real-time sensor traffic while identifying the serious health conditions of patients by using thresholds, statistical methods, and machine-learning techniques. The results show that the proposed system is very efficient and able to process high-speed WBAN sensory data in real time.</p></p>",

Firstly, a nonlinear Markov process is derived from a large number of interacting big networks with symmetric interactions, each of which is described as a continuous-time block-structured Markov process. Secondly, some effective algorithms are given for computing the fixed points of the nonlinear Markov process by means of the UL-type RG-factorization. Finally, the Birkhoff center, the Lyapunov functions and the relative entropy are used to analyze stability or metastability of the big network, and several interesting open problems are proposed with detailed interpretation.

abstract = "Web applications have become increasingly popular due to their potential for businesses' high revenue gain through global reach. Along with these opportunities, also come challenges in terms of Web application security. The increased rise in the number of datadriven applications has also seen an increased rise in their systematic attacks. Cyberattacks exploit Web application vulnerabilities. Attack trends show a major increase in Web application vulnerabilities caused by improper implementation of information-flow control methods and they account for more than 50% of all Web application vulnerabilities found in the year 2013. Static code analysis using methods of information-flow control is a widely acknowledged technique to secure Web applications. Whilst this technique has been found to be both very effective and efficient in finding Web application vulnerabilities, specific tools are highly dependent on the programming language. This thesis leverages Semantic Web technologies in order to offer a common language through source code represented using the Resource Description Framework format, whereby reasoning can be applied to securely test Web applications. In this thesis, we present a framework that extracts source code facts from various programming languages at a variable-level of granularity using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) generated using language grammars and the ANTLR parser generator. The methodology for detecting Web application vulnerabilities implements three phases: entry points identification, tracing information-flow and vulnerability detection using the Jena framework inference mechanism and rules describing patterns of source code. The approach discussed in this thesis is found to be effective and practical in finding Web application vulnerabilities with the limitation that it can only detect patterns that are used as training data or very similar patterns. False positives are caused by limitations of the language grammar, but they do not affect the accuracy of the security vulnerability detection method in identifying the correct Web application vulnerability.

IoT embraces a wide set of heterogeneous services in highly impacting societal sectors, such as Healthcare, Smart Transportation or Media delivery, all of them posing a diverse set of requirements, including real time response, low latency, or high capacity. In order to properly address such diverse set of requirements, the combined use of Cloud and Fog computing turns up as an emerging trend. Indeed, Fog provides low delay for services demanding real time response, constrained to support low capacity queries, whereas Cloud provides high capacity at the cost of a higher latency. It is with no doubt that a new strategy is required to ease the combined operation of cloud and fog infrastructures in IoT scenarios, also referred to as Combined Fog-Cloud (CFC), in terms of service execution performance metrics. To that end, in this paper, we introduce and formulate the QoS-aware service allocation problem for CFC architectures as an integer optimization problem, whose solution minimizes the latency experienced by the services while guaranteeing the fulfillment of the capacity requirements.",

This paper presents a congestion and interference aware energy efficient routing technique for WSN namely, Survivable Path Routing. This protocol is supposed to work in the networks with high traffic because multiple sources try to send their packets to a destination at the same time, which is a typical scenario in IoT applications for remote healthcare monitoring. For selecting the next hop node, the algorithm uses a criterion which is a function of three factors: signal to interference and noise ratio of the link, the survivability factor the path from the next hop node to the destination, and the congestion level at the next hop node. Simulation results suggest that the proposed protocol works better concerning the network throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and the remaining energy level of the nodes. The rate of packet drops is also observed to be lesser in the congested topology scenarios.",

abstract = "In the era of Internet of things, wearable devices can be used to monitor residents’ health and upload collected health data to cloud servers for sharing, which facilitates the development of e-healthcare record (EHR) systems. However, before finding wide applications, EHR systems have to tackle privacy and efficiency challenges. For one thing, the confidentiality of EHRs is one of most important issues concerned by patients. For another, wearable devices in mobile cloud computing are often resource-constrained to some extent. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained EHR access control scheme which is proven secure in the standard model under the decisional parallel bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption. In the proposed scheme, an EHR owner can generate offline ciphertexts before knowing EHR data and access policies, which performs a majority of computation tasks. Furthermore, the online phase can rapidly assemble the final ciphertexts when EHR data and access policies become known. Our EHR access control scheme allows access policies encoded in linear secret sharing schemes. Extensive performance comparisons and simulation results indicate that the proposed solution is very suitable for mobile cloud computing. •We propose a fine-grained EHR access control scheme.•Our scheme allows access policies encoded in linear secret sharing schemes.•Our scheme is proven secure and it is suitable for mobile cloud computing.",

Prediction of symptomatic crises in chronic diseases in the IoT scenario leads to the deployment of ambulatory monitoring systems. These systems place a major concern in the amount of data to be processed and the intelligent management of the energy consumption. The huge amount of data generated for these systems require high computing capabilities only available in Data Centers. This paper presents a real case of prediction in the eHealth scenario, devoted to neurological disorders. The presented case study focuses on the migraine headache, a disease that affects around 15% of the European population. This paper extrapolates results from real data and simulations in a study where migraine patients are monitored using an unobtrusive Wireless Body Sensor Network. Low-power techniques are applied in monitorization nodes. Techniques such us: on-node signal processing and radio policies to make node’s autonomy longer and save energy, have been applied. Workload balancing policies are carried out in the coordinator nodes and Data Centers to reduce the computational burden in these facilities and minimize its energy consumption. Our results draw average savings of € 288 million in this eHealth scenario applied only to 2% of European migraine sufferers; in addition to savings of € 1272 million due to the benefits of the migraine prediction. •A real IoT eHealth scenario for and prediction of the migraine disease is shown.•Energy efficiency techniques in every level of the motorization network.•Low-power techniques in the radio and data processing in the sensing nodes.•Workload balancing policies are carried out in coordinator nodes and Data Centers.•The results show the energetic and economic benefits of the energy policies applied.",

Presented here is a battery-powered and highly portable credit-card size potentiostat that is suitable for performing mobile and wearable amperometric electrochemical measurements with seamless wireless data transfer to mobile computing devices. The mobile electrochemical analytical system has been evaluated in the laboratory with a model redox system – the reduction of hexacyanoferrate(III) – and also with commercially available enzymatic blood-glucose test-strips. The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the ‘missing link’ in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R2=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements. We conclude that the wireless potentiostat could contribute significantly to the advancement of mobile chemical sensor research and adoption, in particular for wearable sensors in healthcare and sport physiology, for wound monitoring and in mobile point-of-sample diagnostics as well as more generally as a part of the Sensor Internet of Things. •Credit-card size mobile/wearable potentiostat with wireless interface.•Inputs designed for amperometric sensors and enzyme-based biosensors.•Wireless RFID/NFC output for communication with Smartphone, tablet or PC.•Evaluation with solution-based redox couple and enzymatic glucose test-strips.",

Induction of IoT devices in the healthcare environment have revitalized multiple features of these applications. The big data generated by IoT devices in healthcare domain is analyzed on the cloud instead of solely relying on limited storage and computation resources of handheld devices. Relative to this context, a cloud-centric IoT basedm-healthcare monitoring disease diagnosing framework is proposed which predicts the potential disease with its level of severity. Key terminologies are defined to generate user-oriented health measurements by exploring the concept of computational sciences. The architectural prototype for smart student healthcare is designed for application scenario. The results are computed after processing the health measurements in a specific context. In our case study, systematic student perspective health data is generated using UCI dataset and medical sensors to predict the student with different disease severity. Diagnosis schemes are applied using various state-of-the-art classification algorithms and the results are computed based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure.

The December workshop is summarized in Nontechnical Strategies to Reduce Children's Exposure to Inappropriate Material on the Internet: Summary of a Workshop. The second workshop was held on March 7, 2001, in Redwood City, California. This second workshop focused on some of the technical, business, and legal factors that affect how one might choose to protect kids from pornography on the Internet. The present report provides, in the form of edited transcripts, the presentations at that workshop.</p>",

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) has inspired solutions that are already available for addressing problems in various application scenarios, such as healthcare, security, emergency support and tourism. However, there is no clear approach to modeling these systems and envisioning their capabilities at the design time. Therefore, the process of designing these systems is ad hoc and its real impact is evaluated once the solution is already implemented, which is risky and expensive. This paper proposes a modeling approach that uses human-centric wireless sensor networks to specify and evaluate models of IoT-based systems at the time of design, avoiding the need to spend time and effort on early implementations of immature designs. It allows designers to focus on the system design, leaving the implementation decisions for a next phase. The article illustrates the usefulness of this proposal through a running example, showing the design of an IoT-based solution to support the first responses during medium-sized or large urban incidents. The case study used in the proposal evaluation is based on a real train crash. The proposed modeling approach can be used to design IoT-based systems for other application scenarios, e.g., to support security operatives or monitor chronic patients in their homes.",

abstract = "With the soaring interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), some healthcare providers are facilitating remote care delivery through the use of wearable devices. These devices are employed for continuous streaming of personal medical data (e.g., vitals, medications, allergies, etc.) into healthcare information systems for the purposes of health monitoring and efficient diagnosis. However, a challenge from the perspective of the physicians is the inability to reliably determine which data belongs to who in real-time. This challenge emanates from the fact that healthcare facilities have numerous users who own multiple devices; thereby creating an N x M data source heterogeneity and complexities for the streaming process. As part of this research, we seek to streamline the process by proposing a wearable IoT data streaming architecture that offers traceability of data routes from the originating source to the health information system. To overcome the complexities of mapping and matching device data to users, we put forward an enhanced Petri Nets service model that aids with a transparent data trace route generation, tracking and the possible detection of medical data compromises. The results from several empirical evaluations conducted in a real-world wearable IoT ecosystem prove that: 1) the proposed system’s choice of Petri Net is best suited for linkability, unlinkability, and transparency of the medical IoT data traceability, 2) under peak load conditions, the IoT architecture exhibits high scalability, and 3) distributed health information system threats such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, spoofing, and masking can be effectively detected.",

abstract = "Pervasive healthcare is one of the most important applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). As part of the IoT, the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are responsible for sensing the abnormal behavior of the elderly or patients. In this article, we design and implement a fall detection system called SensFall . With the resource restricted sensor nodes, it is vital to find an efficient feature to describe the scene. Based on the optical flow analysis, it can be observed that the thermal energy variation of each sub-region of the monitored region is a salient spatio-temporal feature that characterizes the fall. The main contribution of this study is to develop a feature-specific sensing system to capture this feature so as to detect the occurrence of a fall. In our system, the three-dimensional (3D) object space is segmented into some distinct discrete sampling cells, and pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors are employed to detect the variance of the thermal flux within these cells. The hierarchical classifier (two-layer HMMs) is proposed to model the time-varying PIR signal and classify different human activities. We use self-developed PIR sensor nodes mounted on the ceiling and construct a WSN based on ZigBee (802.15.4) protocol. We conduct experiments in a real office environment. The volunteers simulate several kinds of activities including falling, sitting down, standing up from a chair, walking, and jogging. Encouraging experimental results confirm the efficacy of our system.",

This research extended existing work by integrating unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence) and individual differences, namely personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness and extraversion) and demographic characteristics (i.e. age and gender) to predict the adoption of RFID in the healthcare supply chain. Data was collected from 252 physicians and nurses. The research model was tested by employing neural network analysis. During the course of this research, 11 variables were proposed in a bid to predict the adoption of RFID by physicians and nurses. In general, individual differences are able to predict the adoption of RFID better compared to variables derived from UTAUT.

Emergence of context-aware technologies and IoT devices reflect that the quality of a human life has become one of the most essential aspects in Smart Cities. With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b) emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously extending social network of the elderly people.

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.",

In this work, we seek to introduce an IoT-based heart attack detection system, that could be life-saving for patients without risking their need for privacy through the verification and enforcement of opacity.

abstract = "New healthcare technologies are emerging with the increasing age of the society, where the development of smart homes for monitoring the elders’ activities is in the center of them. Identifying the resident’s activities in an apartment is an important module in such systems. Dense sensing approach aims to embed sensors in the environment to report the detected events continuously. The events are segmented and analyzed via classifiers to identify the corresponding activity. Although several methods were introduced in recent years for detecting simple activities, the recognition of complex ones requires more effort. Due to the different time duration and event density of each activity, finding the best size of the segments is one of the challenges in detecting the activity. Also, using appropriate classifiers that are capable of detecting simple and interleaved activities is the other issue. In this paper, we devised a two-phase approach called CARER (Complex Activity Recognition using Emerging patterns and Random forest). In the first phase, the emerging patterns are mined, and various features of the activities are extracted to build a model using the Random Forest technique. In the second phase, the sequences of events are segmented dynamically by considering their recency and sensor correlation. Then, the segments are analyzed by the generated model from the previous phase to recognize both simple and complex activities. We examined the performance of the devised approach using the CASAS dataset. To do this, first we investigated several classifiers. The outcome showed that the combination of emerging patterns and the random forest provide a higher degree of accuracy. Then, we compared CARER with the static window approach, which used Hidden Markov Model. To have a fair comparison, we replaced the dynamic segmentation module of CARER with the static one. The results showed more than 12% improvement in f-measure. Finally, we compared our work with Dynamic sensor segmentation for real-time activity recognition , which used dynamic segmentation. The f-measure metric demonstrated up to 12.73% improvement.",

Since the conducted survey of related works indicated a lack of methodological approaches to the design process, therefore a Design Methodology (DM), which approaches the design target from the perspective of the stakeholders, contracting authorities and potential users, is introduced. The implemented solution applies the three-axial accelerometer and magnetometer, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR), thresholding and the decision trees algorithm. Such an architecture enables the localization of a monitored person within four room-zones with accuracy; furthermore, it identifies falls and the activities of lying, standing, sitting and walking. Based on the identified activities, the system classifies current activities as normal, suspicious or dangerous, which is used to notify the healthcare staff about possible problems. The real-life scenarios validated the high robustness of the proposed solution. Moreover, the test results satisfied both stakeholders and future users and ensured further cooperation with the project.</p>",

To address one of the major challenges of the IoBNT, we present an exemplary architecture and model of a bio-cyber interface for connecting the conventional electromagnetic-based Internet to the biochemical signaling-based bionanonetwork. The bio-cyber interface is designed and modeled by employing biological concepts, such as the responsiveness of certain biomolecules to thermal and light stimuli, and the bioluminescence phenomenon of some biochemical reactions. The analysis in this paper focuses on the system that comprises the bio-cyber interface and the information propagation network of the blood vessel that leads to the in-body nanonetwork location.

A body sensor network (BSN) is a type of network for Internet of Things. A BSN typically consists of tens (dozens) of biosensor nodes distributed on/in the human body, and these autonomous nodes can form a wireless network to measure physiological signals and execute intelligent treatment automatically. BSNs have wide application prospects in intelligent healthcare. Because physiological signals measured and processed by BSNs involve patient privacy, security mechanisms must be developed to secure BSNs, and therefore the adoption of available key negotiation protocols is fundamental. Due to stringently limited operation resources, BSNs require these protocols to be highly energy efficient. Recent development has discovered that certain physiological signals can be used for efficiently negotiating common keys among biosensor nodes. These signals and fuzzy technology are used to design lightweight key negotiation protocols, and many solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we explore and classify these solutions, and evaluate their performance by analyzing their merits and drawbacks.

Increasing interest of WSNs is even caused by equally intense growth of interest in the Internet of Things domain, IoT, in which WSNs constitute a significant part. These reasons have brought about developing low cost, low-power and multi-function sensor nodes. However, the major fact that sensor nodes run quickly out of energy has been an issue and many energy efficient routing protocols have been proposed to solve this problem. Case study presented in this paper concern design of WSN in IoT concept from system lifetime perspective. A hierarchical routing technique, which shows energy efficiency, has been validated.

Design/methodology/approach This is exemplified by an application scenario in healthcare that was developed in the context of the OpSIT project in Germany. A clearly outlined three-layer architecture, in the sense of Internet of Things, is presented. It provides the basis for integrating a broad range of sensors into smart healthcare infrastructure. More specifically, by making use of short-range communication sensors (sensing layer), gateways which implement data transmission and low-level computation (fog layer) and cloud computing for processing the data (application layer). Findings A technical in-depth analysis of the first two layers of the infrastructure is given to prove reliability and to determine the communication quality and availability in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, two example use-cases that directly apply to a healthcare environment are examined, concluding with the feasibility of the presented approach. Practical implications Finally, the next research steps, oriented towards the semantic tagging and classification of data received from sensors, and the usage of advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithms on this information to produce useful knowledge, are described together with the derived social benefits.

The IoT-cloudification scales up data centers to a high computational resource capacity, to suit the requirements of a large number of users wanting to access multiple services offered by revolutionary IoT applications which, in turn, consume huge amounts of data produced by billions of things. In such systems, IoT-tailored cloud services (e.g., software platforms and middleware) are responsible for running latency-critical IoT applications in different areas (e.g., healthcare, transport systems, safety, Smart Cities, and many others). These applications expect to produce high-density multimedia flows that must be handled appropriately by the underlying communication infrastructure to obtain transport services of the highest standard. In this work, we propose a novel control plane optimization, which leverages the support of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate so that it can advance beyond today’s IP-based communication systems, which reveals weaknesses (e.g. a limited performance and scalability) in delivering multimedia content through per-flow channels. An attempt is made to overcome these limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol approach that exploits the SDN substrate to offload the flow streaming network-computing task from the IoT cloud platform to selected SDN branching nodes, and hence ensures high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloud system as a whole. To achieve this, CLASSICO dynamically builds application-layer sessions, which comprise multiple participant members sharing same interested content, and connects them into optimal multiuser tree structures, whereby only selected branching nodes apply SDN replication function for quality-enhanced transport service. We applied CLASSICO to a multimedia use case, and the results show that it outperforms multicast-capable IoT systems in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video assessment metrics. •Massive IoT multimedia flows must be handled to support efficient cloud services.•IoT multimedia applications are expected to request common content.•A cross-layer multimedia SDN-oriented session control is proposed.•Proposed solution improves delay, jitter, throughput, SSIM and VQM.",

In the proposed scheme, data is compressed with both lossy and lossless techniques, so as to enable hybrid transmission mode, support adaptive data rate selection and save power in wireless transmission. Applying the method to electrocardiogram (ECG), the data is first compressed using a lossy compression technique with a high compression ratio (CR). The residual error between the original data and the decompressed lossy data is preserved using entropy coding, enabling a lossless restoration of the original data when required. Average CR of 2.1$\times$ and 7.8$\times$ were achieved for lossless and lossy compression respectively with MIT/BIH database. The power reduction is demonstrated using a Bluetooth transceiver and is found to be reduced to 18&#x0025; for lossy and 53&#x0025; for lossless transmission respectively.

The potential of IoT technologies and deployments has been already demonstrated in a number of different application areas, including transport, energy, safety and healthcare. However, despite the growing number of IoT deployments, the majority of IoT applications tend to be self-contained, thereby forming application silos. A lightweight data centric integration and combination of these silos presents several challenges that still need to be addressed. Indeed, the ability to combine and synthesize data streams and services from diverse IoT platforms and testbeds, holds the promise to increase the potentiality of smart applications in terms of size, scope and targeted business context. In this article, a proof-of-concept implementation that federates two different IoT experimentation facilities by means of semantic-based technologies will be described. The specification and design of the implemented system and information models will be described together with the practical details of the developments carried out and its integration with the existing IoT platforms supporting the aforementioned testbeds.

It examines the organizational dynamics of IoMT and develops a conceptual model for quality of experience (QoE) in user acceptance. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the information systems success model of quality factor as an analytical framework and extends it beyond the individual user experience (UX) to include an organization-level perspective. Interviews are conducted with relevant stakeholders for sociotechnical inquiries; a survey identifies user factors in IoMT. Findings The sociotechnical analysis sheds light on how IoMT has been accepted and stabilized in the healthcare sector. It shows the complex interaction between the social and technical aspects of IoMT by highlighting the co-evolution, interaction, and interface of devices that constitute the next-generation network environment. The UX model conceptualizes QoE specific to medical informatics. Research limitations/implications Given the sociotechnical nature of this investigation, another approach to adoption of IoMT innovations was worth investigating to determine effective integration. Practical implications IoMT needs to be meaningful if they are to be sustainable and they need to offer quality of services and QoE no matter the location or demographic in which they are used. Originality/value With a dual-level analysis, the study provides a comprehensive view of the IoMT development process by investigating the organizational dynamics, in addition to the UX, of IoMT. The results provide a basis for developing future IoMT services with QoE requirements, as well as for clarifying sociotechnical dynamics.",

Each student with autism comes with her or his own unique needs and an array of behaviors and habits that can be severe and which interfere with everyday tasks. Autism is associated with intellectual disability, impairments in social skills, and physical health issues such as sleep and abdominal disturbances. We have designed an Internet-of-Things (IoT) framework named WearSense that leverages the sensing capabilities of modern smartwatches to detect stereotypic behaviors in children with autism. In this work, we present a study that used the inbuilt accelerometer of a smartwatch to detect three behaviors, including hand flapping, painting, and sibbing that are commonly observed in children with autism. In this feasibility study, we recruited 14 subjects to record the accelerometer data from the smartwatch worn on the wrist. The processing part extracts 34 different features in each dimension of the three-axis accelerometer, resulting in 102 features. Using and comparing various classification techniques revealed that an ensemble of 40 decision trees has the best accuracy of around 94.6%. This accuracy shows the quality of the data collected from the smartwatch and feature extraction methods used in this study. The recognition of these behaviors by using a smartwatch would be helpful in monitoring individuals with autistic behaviors, since the smartwatch can send the data to the cloud for comprehensive analysis and also to help parents, caregivers, and clinicians make informed decisions.",

abstract = "Cloud computing (CC) is one of the most popular technologies which provides on-demand ubiquitous services to the geo-located end users. Such services are hosted by physical infrastructure deployed at massive data centers (DCs) at various geographic locations. For handling millions of service requests, DCs consume a large amount of energy which increases the overall operational expenditure, grid load, and carbon footprints. So, to handle these issues, the integration of DCs with renewable energy sources (RES) is one of the solutions used by the research community from past many years. However, with an increase in smart communities such as — smart cities, smart healthcare, and Internet of things (IoT), the dependence of users on CC has increased many folds. Hence, to deal with the service requests and the data generated from smart devices (vehicles, IoT sensors, and actuators) locally, a recent paradigm popularly known as Edge computing has emerged. But, to execute various applications smoothly, there is a movement of high volume of data across different geographically separated nodes which create a huge burden on the network infrastructure. Moreover, the interoperability of various mobile devices is one of the major concerns for effective network infrastructure usage. Therefore, to deal with above challenges, an emerging paradigm known as software defined networks (SDN) can be a suitable choice. Hence, in this paper, an efficient scheme for energy management with sustainability (MEnSuS) of Cloud Data Centers in Edge–Cloud Environment using SDN is presented. In the proposed scheme, a support vector machine-based workload classification approach is presented. Moreover, a two-stage game for workload scheduling for sustainability of DCs is designed. In order to achieve energy efficiency and optimal utilization of network and computing resources, different consolidation schemes are also presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Google workload traces and the results obtained prove the effectiveness. •An energy management scheme for sustainability of cloud data centers in the edge cloud environment is presented.•Support vector machine is used for designing workload classification scheme in edge–cloud environment.•SDN based model is designed to deal with the issues of congestion at the network during data transmission.",

An additional challenge is the growing number of counterfeit components in these devices, resulting in serious reliability and financial implications. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising security primitive to help address these concerns. Memory-based PUFs are particularly attractive as they require minimal or no additional hardware for their operation. However, current memory-based PUFs utilize only a single memory technology for constructing the PUF, which has several disadvantages including making them vulnerable to security attacks. In this paper, we propose the design of a new memory-based combination PUF that intelligently combines two memory technologies, SRAM and DRAM, to overcome these shortcomings. The proposed combination PUF exhibits high entropy, supports a large number of challenge-response pairs, and is intrinsically reconfigurable. We have implemented the proposed combination PUF using a Terasic TR4-230 FPGA board and several off-the-shelf SRAMs and DRAMs. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over current memory-based PUFs including the ability to resist various attacks. Extensive authentication tests across a wide temperature range (20 - 60 deg. Celsius) and accelerated aging (12 months) demonstrate the robustness of the proposed design, which achieves a 100% true-positive rate and 0% false-positive rate for authentication across these parameter ranges.",

DPHK predicts and sends predicted data at one time instead of sending the triggered data of these sensor nodes which people is going to pass in several times. Firstly, our system learns the knowledge of transition probability among sensor nodes from the historical binary motion data through data mining. Secondly, it stores the corresponding knowledge in each sensor node based on a special storage mechanism. Thirdly, each sensor node applies HMM (hidden Markov model) algorithm to predict the sensor node locations people will arrive at according to the receivedmessage. At last, these sensor nodes send their triggered data and the predicted data to the sink node. The significances of DPHK are as follows: (a) the procedure of DPHK is distributed (b) it effectively reduces the connection between sensor nodes and sink node.

abstract = "Due to our rapidly aging society, there has been an increasing need for preventive management of chronic diseases and management of individual health conditions. Among the chronic diseases, diabetes has become one of the most important illnesses in the modern era, and there is an increasing number of diabetes patients in all age groups. With increasing concern for ubiquitous health care services and the developing information technology, there has been a rapid increase in the convenience of preventive management for various types of disease and health conditions. In addition, demand for the management of chronic diseases by using internet of things devices has been increasing. In this study, a personal health record (PHR)-based diabetes index service model is suggested by analyzing lifestyles. For the method suggested in this study, a PHR-based mobile service for users is provided while developing the diabetes index model using lifestyle analysis. By utilizing the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as a fundamental resource, this study analyzes the correlation and differentiation of a non-diabetic group and a diabetic group. For the selection of items in correlation, a multivariate analysis algorithm is used. A PHR related to health behavior and dietary habits in the same pattern is collected from users according to pre-chosen items. The Minkowski distance formula is used for the algorithm for PHR predictive analysis for users and chosen items. Resources on health conditions and dietary habits in the same pattern are collected from users, while calculating similarities among diabetes patients. By using the weight of calculated similarity, a diabetes index is derived. In addition, a management information service for preventing diabetes is offered through derived resources. A mobile application is developed from a smart health care platform to provide services at any time and any place. The mobile application’s interface is configured for users to conveniently enter the PHR and check their health conditions on a real-time basis. It is feasible for each user to check the results from feedback by using the PHR. This quantifies the diabetes index and provides information about desirable health behavior and dietary habits related to diabetes at the same time. Users are able to conveniently apply them in real life with the provided services. Therefore, it is available to improve the health conditions of users and to prevent disease.",

Yet there is little research examining the impact of those concerns on consumers' behavioral patterns related to the post-adoptive use of healthcare wearable devices. The purpose of this study is to examine how consumers attain extended use of healthcare wearable devices in the presence of health and privacy concerns. This study empirically tests a novel research model drawing on coping theory and coping model of user adaptation. Data were collected from United States consumers using stratified and random sampling method. The effective sample included 260 responses from consumers. The results indicate that consumers' health and privacy concerns initiate a coping process. Problem-focused and emotion-focused coping efforts significantly predict the extended use of healthcare wearable devices. This study offers several implications for theory and research. Most notably, it demonstrates the viability of coping as a high-level theoretical lens for examining consumers’ post-adoptive use of information technology. •The purpose of the present study is to examine the entire process of infusion of healthcare wearable devices.•Consumers' adaptation to healthcare wearable device is analyzed by applying coping theory and CMUA.•Consumers' health and privacy concerns have significant impact on challenge and threat appraisals.•Problem and emotion-focused coping efforts determine the extended use (infusion) of healthcare wearable devices.•Implications for academicians and practitioners were suggested.",

Then, in the second stage, the collected data are sent over a Femto-LTE network following a new scheduling technique.

Nowadays, the IoT has been used widely and commonly by a variety of domains, such as transportation and logistics domain and healthcare domain. However, missing values are very common in the IoT for a variety of reasons, which results in the fact that the experimental data are incomplete. As a result of this, some work, which is related to the data of the IoT, can’t be carried out normally. And it leads to the reduction in the accuracy and reliability of the data analysis results. This paper, for the characteristics of the data itself and the features of missing data in IoT, divides the missing data into three types and defines three corresponding missing value imputation problems. Then, we propose three new models to solve the corresponding problems, and they are model of missing value imputation based on context and linear mean (MCL), model of missing value imputation based on binary search (MBS), and model of missing value imputation based on Gaussian mixture model (MGI). Experimental results showed that the three models can improve the accuracy, reliability, and stability of missing value imputation greatly and effectively.",

These new sensors quantify individual components in mixtures, reject interferences, and offer more stable response over sensor arrays. Such performance is attractive when selectivity advantages of classic gas chromatography, ion mobility, and mass spectrometry instruments are canceled by requirements for no consumables, low power, low cost, and unobtrusive form factors for Internet of Things, Industrial Internet, and other applications.

In 1945, when he was head of the power tube division at Raytheon, Spencer became the first to investigate why a candy bar had melted in his pocket while he was testing a magnetron tube. Before long, Raytheon had a patent on the first microwave, the Radarange, which weighed 750 pounds and sold as a commercial cooker for $2,000 to $3,000 to restaurants, ocean liners and passenger trains as a way to conveniently provide warm meals.

However, the smart cities based on distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models). Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection: imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of urban services and decision making.

We will focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. As experimentation we present a special case of modeling imperfect data in the field of Healthcare. An evidential database will be built which will contain all the perfect and imperfect data. These data come from several Heterogeneous sources in a context of Smart Cities. Imperfect aspects in the evidential database expressed by the theory of beliefs that will present in this paper.

abstract = "  As suggested in the previous Communications Inside Risks column, the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to encompass and instrument an enormous range of connected devices -- including home appliances and utilities, wearables, homes and corporate buildings, industrial processes, medical devices, law-enforcement devices, military equipment, and other connected applications that today might be barely imaginable. In the present context, {"}Things{"} are simply those computerized and networked devices that become part of the IoT. Some of those Things will be directly accessible over the Internet, whereas others would be supposedly hidden in local networks behind firewalls and address -- translating routers. Security and privacy are both extremely important in the IoT, because the potential consequences of successful attacks could impact human lives and safety, and cause death and destruction -- directly or indirectly. Privacy violations that let criminals exploit information about potential victims can also constitute threats to safety.",

Cloud computing and the Internet of Things are the two hot points in the Internet application field. The application of the two new technologies is in hot discussion and research, but quite less on the field of medical monitoring and managing application. Thus, in this paper, we study and analyze the application of cloud computing and the Internet of Things on the medical field. And we manage to make a combination of the two techniques in the medical monitoring and managing field. The model architecture for remote monitoring cloud platform of healthcare information (RMCPHI) was established firstly. Then the RMCPHI architecture was analyzed. Finally an efficient PSOSAA algorithm was proposed for the medical monitoring and managing application of cloud computing. Simulation results showed that our proposed scheme can improve the efficiency about 50%.",

abstract = "Modern healthcare services are serving patients needs by using new technologies such as wearable devices or cloud of things. The new technology provides more facilities and enhancements to the existing healthcare services as it allows more flexibility in terms of monitoring patients records and remotely connecting with the patients via cloud of things. However, there are many security issues such as privacy and security of healthcare data which need to be considered once we introduce wearable devices to the healthcare service. Although some of the security issues were addressed by some researchers in the literature, they mainly addressed cloud of things security or healthcare security separately and their work still suffers from limited security protection and vulnerabilities to some security attacks. The proposed new healthcare system combines security of both healthcare and cloud of things technologies. It also addresses most of the security challenges that might face the healthcare services such as the man in the middle (MITM), eavesdropping, replay, repudiation, and modification attacks.

Still, due to security vulnerabilities, personal health and medical information is prone to hacking attacks. Thus, concerns over privacy invasion have come to the fore, and at the same time security issues are considered to override information services. This paper proposes a communication protocol based on hash lock, session keys, random numbers and security keys designed to be safe against intruders’ hacking attempts in information communication between medical devices. Instead of arguing for the safety of the proposed protocol with mathematical theorem proving as in prior research on protocol proving, this paper verifies the safety of the proposed authentication protocol against a range of attacks using a model checking program, Casper/FDR program. In brief, the proposed communication protocol for medical devices is safe and secure against diverse attacks.",

However, a challenge faced by healthcare industry is the limited adoption and use of RFID by physicians and nurses. This research extended existing work by integrating unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence) and individual differences, namely personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness and extraversion) and demographic characteristics (i.e. age and gender) to predict the adoption of RFID in the healthcare supply chain. Data was collected from 252 physicians and nurses. The research model was tested by employing neural network analysis. During the course of this research, 11 variables were proposed in a bid to predict the adoption of RFID by physicians and nurses. In general, individual differences are able to predict the adoption of RFID better compared to variables derived from UTAUT. This study contributes to the growing interest in understanding the acceptance of RFID in the healthcare industry. •RFID acceptance in the healthcare supply chain is examined.•Conceptual model is derived by extending UTAUT model with the big five factors.•A neural network model was developed to predict variables influencing RFID adoption in healthcare supply chain.•Individual differences are the better choice for prediction of the adoption of RFID in healthcare supply chain.",

Multiple sensor nodes can be deployed on different positions of the body to measure the subject&#x2019;s body temperature distribution, heartbeat, and detect falls. A web-based smartphone application is also developed for displaying the sensor data and fall notification. To extend the lifetime of the wearable sensor node, a flexible solar energy harvester with an output-based maximum power point tracking technique is used to power the sensor node. Experimental results show that the wearable sensor node works well when powered by the solar energy harvester. The autonomous 24 h operation is achieved with the experimental results. The proposed system with solar energy harvesting demonstrates that long-term continuous medical monitoring based on WBAN is possible provided that the subject stays outside for a short period of time in a day.",

Many issues are involved, including transportation, energy savings, disaster management, environmental protection, education, healthcare, and security. Currently, the government of Taiwan is cooperating with telephone companies and industries to implement the smart city program. Major telecommunication companies have actively responded to the government strategy and made it a principal of their business development. The program proposed by Chunghwa Telecom aims to assist central and local governments in achieving smart cities by the end of 2017. The program includes the &#x0022;convenient city,&#x0022; &#x0022;happy city,&#x0022; and &#x0022;friendly city,&#x0022; initiatives, which comprise three programs and 12 subprograms. Because of smart cities' diverse demands, a powerful and effective platform is necessary. This article describes a cloud virtualization resource management system called CHT Virtuoso.

abstract = "In recent years, with the increase in degenerative diseases and the aging population in advanced countries, demands for medical care of older or solitary people have increased continually in hospitals and healthcare institutions. Applying wireless sensor networks for the IoT-based telemedicine system enables doctors, caregivers or families to monitor patients' physiological conditions at anytime and anyplace according to the acquired information. However, transmitting physiological data through the Internet concerns the personal privacy of patients. Therefore, before users can access medical care services in IoT-based medical care system, they must be authenticated. Typically, user authentication and data encryption are most critical for securing network communications over a public channel between two or more participants. In 2016, Liu and Chung proposed a bilinear pairing-based password authentication scheme for wireless healthcare sensor networks. They claimed their authentication scheme cannot only secure sensor data transmission, but also resist various well-known security attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that Liu-Chung's scheme has some security weaknesses, and we further present an improved secure authentication and data encryption scheme for the IoT-based medical care system, which can provide user anonymity and prevent the security threats of replay and password/sensed data disclosure attacks. Moreover, we modify the authentication process to reduce redundancy in protocol design, and the proposed scheme is more efficient in performance compared with previous related schemes. Finally, the proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under ECDHP.",

Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services. However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform.",

abstract = "Recently, big data analytics has received important attention in a variety of application domains including business, finance, space science, healthcare, telecommunication and Internet of Things (IoT). Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing. More importantly, we identify and describe the potential key enablers for the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework, the associated key challenges and some interesting future research directions.",

abstract = "<p>As a key technology in smart healthcare monitoring systems, wireless body area networks (WBANs) can pre-embed sensors and sinks on body surface or inside bodies for collecting different vital signs parameters, such as human Electrocardiograph (ECG), Electroencephalograph (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), body temperature, blood pressure, blood sugar, blood oxygen, etc. Using real-time online healthcare, patients can be tracked and monitored in normal or emergency conditions at their homes, hospital rooms, and in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). In particular, the reliability and effectiveness of the packets transmission will be directly related to the timely rescue of critically ill patients with life-threatening injuries. However, traditional fault-tolerant schemes either have the deficiency of underutilised resources or react too slowly to failures. In future healthcare systems, the medical Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time monitoring can integrate sensor networks, cloud computing, and big data techniques to address these problems. It can collect and send patient’s vital parameter signal and safety monitoring information to intelligent terminals and enhance transmission reliability and efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents a design in healthcare monitoring systems for a proactive reliable data transmission mechanism with resilience requirements in a many-to-one stream model. This Network Coding-based Fault-tolerant Mechanism (NCFM) first proposes a greedy grouping algorithm to divide the topology into small logical units; it then constructs a spanning tree based on random linear network coding to generate linearly independent coding combinations. Numerical results indicate that this transmission scheme works better than traditional methods in reducing the probability of packet loss, the resource redundant rate, and average delay, and can increase the effective throughput rate.</p>",

At the same time, people living with old adults suffering from a progressive brain disorder such as Alzheimer's disease are enduring even more stress and depression than those patients while caring for them. Accordingly, seniors' ability to live independently and comfortably in their current home for as long as possible has been crucial to reduce the societal cost for caregiving and thus give family members peace of mind, called 'aging in place' (AIP). In this paper we present a way of building AIP services using standard-based IoT platforms and heterogeneous IoT products. An AIP service platform is designed and created by combining previous standard-based IoT platforms in a collaborative way. A service composition tool is also created that allows people to create AIP services in an efficient way. To show practical usability of our proposed system, we choose a service scenario for medication compliance and implement a prototype service which could give old adults medication reminder appropriately at the right time (i.e., when it is time to need to take pills) through light and speaker at home but also wrist band and smartphone even outside the home.",

abstract = "Intelligent products are an undeniable asset for efficient product lifecycle management (PLM), providing ways to capture events related to physical objects at various locations and times. Today and more than ever before, PLM tools and systems must be built upon standards for enhancing interoperability among all product stakeholders and developing tools independent of specific vendors, applications, and operating systems. Based on this observation, this paper develops strategies to improve “information sustainability” in PLM environments using standardized communication interfaces defined by a recent standard proposal named quantum lifecycle management (QLM) messaging standards. More concretely, data synchronization models based upon QLM standards are developed to enable the synchronization of product-related information among various systems, networks, and organizations involved throughout the product lifecycle. Our proposals are implemented and assessed based on two distinct platforms defined in the healthcare and home automation sectors.",

We then performed sentiment analysis to gain insights of the public's attitude towards the IoT. As anticipated, our analysis indicates that the public's perception of the IoT is predominantly positive. Further, through topic modeling, we learned that public tweets discussing the IoT were often focused on business and technology. However, the public has great concerns about privacy and security issues toward the IoT based on the frequent appearance of related terms. Nevertheless, no unexpected perceptions were identified through our analysis. Our analysis was challenged by the limited fraction of tweets relevant to our study.

As wireless internet has spread widely over the world, it can be readily used to communicate information related to, for example, human health. Indeed, some institutes have demonstrated the measurement of physical vital signals (e.g., temperature, pulse, and heartbeat) of the body for monitoring through a smartphone. However, biochemical analytes such as proteins and bacteria are currently difficult to measure based on antigen-antibody binding due to several technological barriers. Among them, the terminal unit of detection for, for instance, pathogens is mostly bulky, insensitive, or even expensive for sophisticated devices. We have studied the use of CMOS image sensor (CIS) for detecting the signal produced from an immuno-analytical system, which could resolve the detection issue hindering monitoring via IoT. In this study, an immunosensor system using CIS for detection means was fabricated to pocket-sized dimensions and then employed for determining a food-borne pathogen, the Vibrio species, in real samples.

abstract = "<p>Lately, we see that Internet of things (IoT) is introduced in medical services for global connection among patients, sensors, and all nearby things. The principal purpose of this global connection is to provide context awareness for the purpose of bringing convenience to a patient's life and more effectively implementing clinical processes. In health care, monitoring of biosignals of a patient has to be continuously performed while the patient moves inside and outside the hospital. Also, to monitor the accurate location and biosignals of the patient, appropriate mobility management is necessary to maintain connection between the patient and the hospital network. In this paper, a binding update scheme on PMIPv6, which reduces signal traffic during location updates by Virtual LMA (VLMA) on the top original Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) Domain, is proposed to reduce the total cost. If a Mobile Node (MN) moves to a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)-located boundary of an adjacent LMA domain, the MN changes itself into a virtual mode, and this movement will be assumed to be a part of the VLMA domain. In the proposed scheme, MAGs eliminate global binding updates for MNs between LMA domains and significantly reduce the packet loss and latency by eliminating the handoff between LMAs. In conclusion, the performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme improves performance significantly versus PMIPv6 and HMIPv6 in terms of the binding update rate per user and average handoff latency.</p>",

abstract = "Healthcare concerns have become diverse, ranging from acute and chronic conditions to lifestyle, wellbeing and the prevention of illness. Increasingly, individuals are taking responsibility for monitoring their own conditions. Healthcare technologies are increasingly used not only for administration, but also in specialist treatments and many forms of monitoring, including when a person is mobile. As well as formal interactions with professional carers and results from specialist procedures, care may involve ad hoc interactions with an individual’s community. Together, these yield a wealth of data relevant in different contexts. Unfortunately, many existing healthcare systems are inflexible, single-purpose, and self-contained, so that we cannot fully realise their potential. We believe that a framework for flexible interoperability of healthcare-relevant components is crucial, in a time of increasing need from an ageing population. We present a vision of . To achieve this we believe that the application logic embodied in components should be separated from the policy that specifies where and how they should be used—which may be in ways not contemplated by their original designers. Middleware should therefore provide a framework that supports not only traditional communication among components but also dynamic reconfiguration of components in response to circumstances that arise, with the management and enforcement of high-level policy integrated with the middleware. By this means, functionality for patients, carers and health administrators can be customised and provided as, when and where required. This paper explores middleware requirements and challenges arising from technology- and population-driven developments in healthcare provision. We describe the specific requirements that middleware must address, and present some practical steps towards addressing these from the initial stages of a middleware (SBUS).",

We present a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user&#x2019;s goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains.",

Then, we discuss the benefits of indoor greeneries for improving indoor living environment which leads a better physical health and mental health for home users. As greeneries are integrated into Smart Home 1.0, we propose an evolution from traditional smart home solution to Smart Home 2.0 to achieve the organic integration between users and greeneries. To verify our proposal, a prototype system of Smart Home 2.0 is designed and implemented. The experimental results show the smooth data flows from sensors deployed in smart green house to data center.

This is problematic as young sexual minority women report heightened negative sexual health outcomes in contrast to their heterosexual peers, which could be partially addressed through being able to access effective, relevant online sexual health information sources. This exploratory qualitative study employed a series of focus groups to understand more about what types of online resources young sexual minority women access, their motivations for using those resources, and what types of sexual health information they need. The focus group data were analyzed from a thematic analysis approach. Results indicate that participants used a wide range of online resources, such as apps, websites, blogs, and YouTube. The type of resource accessed often depended upon the information needed. Participants reported preferring online resources due to experiences or expectations of heteronormativity from their sexual health service providers, convenience and accessibility, the capacity to remain anonymous, and the lack of relevant sexual health information offline.

We then performed sentiment analysis to gain insights of the public’s attitude towards the IoT. As anticipated, our analysis indicates that the public's perception of the IoT is predominantly positive. Further, through topic modeling, we learned that public tweets discussing the IoT were often focused on business and technology. However, the public has great concerns about privacy and security issues toward the IoT based on the frequent appearance of related terms. Nevertheless, no unexpected perceptions were identified through our analysis. Our analysis was challenged by the limited fraction of tweets relevant to our study.

Recent proposals simplify the communication management with graphical views or language extensions but still require programmers to explicitly manage communication. To liberate programmers from explicit communication management, this article revisits heterogeneous distributed shared memory (HDSM) for IoT devices and proposes a compiler-runtime cooperative HDSM framework, called IoT-HDSM. The framework's compiler unifies heterogeneous memory layouts of different IoT devices, and the runtime system provides a shared memory view for the devices. To support lightweight devices that cannot execute the runtime, the compiler automatically inserts explicit communication instructions into the IoT application. Moreover, to efficiently control concurrent memory accesses without locks, the authors also propose a new annotation called the memory branch, which provides a memory snapshot for each device. This article describes the implementation of three IoT services with IoT-HDSM and shows that IoT-HDSM simplifies shared data management without harming QoS.",

Methods: A Naive Bayesian Network (NBN) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users, and Google Maps Web service is used to provide the geographic positioning system (GPS)-based risk assessment to prevent the outbreak. It is used to represent each ZikaV infected user, mosquito-dense sites, and breeding sites on the Google map that helps the government healthcare authorities to control such risk-prone areas effectively and efficiently. Results: The performance and accuracy of the proposed system are evaluated using dataset for 2 million users. Our system provides high accuracy for initial diagnosis of different users according to their symptoms and appropriate GPS-based risk assessment.

Due to the danger of wireless transmission circumstance, the security of the data which are collected by the sensors and also transmitted to the doctors faces challenges. In the past decade, many authentication schemes for WMSNs are proposed. However, security disadvantages have been found in such schemes. To overcome the historical security problems, we propose a robust and lightweight authentication scheme for WMSNs, which meets the common security requirements, and keeps away user tracking from attackers. The popular tool Proverif is employed to express that our scheme resists the simulated attacks. Also, the informal security analysis is demonstrated. With the comparison to several very recent schemes and simulation by NS-3, the proposed scheme is suitable for PHSs. •A lightweight two-factor authentication scheme using WMSNs away from being tracked is presented.•We use the famous tool Proverif to prove that our scheme is secure against the common attacks.•The informal analysis and performance comparison with recent schemes show that ours is the best.•The simulation with NS-3 shows that our scheme is applicable for practice.",

We survey existing work on mobile M2M communications, we identify open challenges that have a direct impact on performance and resource usage efficiency, especially the impact on energy efficiency, and we review techniques to improve communications. We review the ETSI standard and application protocols, and draw considerations on the impact of their use in constrained mobile devices. Nowadays, smartphones are equipped with a wide range of embedded sensors, with varied local and wide area connectivity capabilities, and thus they offer a unique opportunity to serve as mobile gateways for other more constrained devices with local connectivity. At the same time, they can gather context data about users and environment from the embedded sensors. These capabilities may be crucial for mobile M2M applications. Finally, in this paper, we consider a scenario where smartphones are used as gateways that collect and aggregate data from sensors in a cellular network. We conclude that, in order for their use to the feasible in terms of a normal depletion time of a smartphone's battery, it is a good advice to maximize the collection of data necessary to be transmitted from nearby sensors, and maximize the intervals between transmissions.

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) as an emerging network paradigm is bringing the next scientific and technological revolution for ubiquitous things’ interactions in cyber-physical-social spaces. The IoT influences the current science and technology system by enabling its relatively stable interrelations for an inevitable architecture reconfiguration. In this paper, we aim to explore an updated science and technology framework for the IoT. Particularly, a novel cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) space is established by involving an attractive concept of the Internet of Thinking (IoTk), and a science and technology framework is accordingly proposed referring to both scientific aspect (i.e., cyber-physical, social, and noetic sciences) and technological aspect (i.e., fundamental, physical, cyber, and social technologies). According to the perspective of the traditional Chinese culture, we explain the established science and technology framework, in which the “Five Elements” (i.e., wood, fire, earth, metal, and water) have common properties with the restructured cyber-physical science in the IoT. Moreover, we introduce a scenario of smart city to identify the technological aspect in the IoT, and discuss the key enabling technologies, including resource management, energy management, data management, session management, security and privacy, loop control, space-time consistency, nanotechnology, and quantum technology. It turns out that the established science and technology framework will launch an innovation for academia and industry communities.",

The development of Internet of Things (IoT) and latest Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have changed the nature of healthcare monitoring and health behaviour intervention in many applications. Water hygiene and water conservation behaviour intervention as important influence factors to human health are gaining much attentions for improving sustained sanitation practice. Based on face-to-face delivery, typical behaviour intervention method is costly and hardly to provide all day access to personalised intervention guidance and feedbacks. In this study, we presented a behavioural information system and water use behaviour model using IoT platform. Using Expanded Theory of Planned Behaviour (ETPB) and adopted structure equation model, this study offers a solution for understanding the behaviour intervention mechanism and methodology for developing empirical model. A case study of behaviour intervention model is presented by utilising residential water conservation behaviour data collected in China. Results suggested that cultural differences have significant influences on the understanding of intervention drivers, promoting projects and increasing awareness, which could improve the behaviour intervention efficiency and further facilitate the improvement of water hygiene practice.

abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The hospital's design today must be prepared for changes resulting from the incorporation of new information and communication technologies (ICT) (1). These will affect non-finalistic (warehouse, archive), diagnostic support (laboratory and image) and finalistic activities (emergency, surgical center, clinics) (2). The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is fundamental in the dimension of the impact of each technology on the structure of healthcare facilities (HCF). In this way, this work intends to evaluate the trends of impact of the new ICT on hospitals’ structure. METHODS: The main technologies under discussion in Management of HCF in Brazillian Health Regulatory Agency were raised. From this survey an impact matrix was built with hospital environmental design and the trends of adequacy of its space. RESULTS: ICT that tend to decrease the physical space are: electronic health record for the archive, use of digital imaging for radiology, Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) for the warehouse, point of care and automated laboratory equipment for clinical laboratories. ICT that tend to increase physical space are: Telemedicine for the surgical center, Internet of Things - IoT for Intensive Care Units, beds for emergency and hospitalization. The technologies that present an undefined tendency in relation to physical space are: automatic dispensers of drugs for nursing posts. The use of database servers and the need for network points are still undefined due to the use of Wi-Fi technology and cloud storage. However, it's possible to increase use of electricity and the internet. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the new ICT will have an impact on the planning and building of the future HCF (3). The designs of today's buildings should consider this trend so that the future reality is adequate and the regulatory requirements about HCF should be able to consider it.",

Healthcare is a particularly attractive sector for cyber attackers because a) healthcare information systems are not up to date compared to other industries, and b) healthcare data fetches a handsome price in the black market for stolen personal information. While technology optimists and vendors continue to make the case (rightly) for improving healthcare quality and lowering the overall costs of care through timely interventions and prevention of hospitalizations using connected devices, health systems (equally correctly) are cautious about exposing their infrastructure and networks to malicious attacks from IoT devices. [...]budgets for IT security have gone up significantly. [...]instead of simply throwing money at the problem, especially on technology tools, organizations such as Group Health Cooperative (GHC), a Seattle-based health system, are focusing more on process improvement, automated incident response and early containment.

abstract = "Cloud-based healthcare service with the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is a model for healthcare delivery for urban areas and vulnerable population that utilizes the digital communications and the IoHT to provide flexible opportunities to transform all the health data into workable, personalized health insights, and help attain wellness outside the traditional hospital setting. This model of healthcare Web services acts like a living organism, taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by running in cloud infrastructure to connect patients and providers anywhere and anytime to improve the quality of care, with the IoHT, acting as a central nervous system for this model that measures patients&#x2019; vital statistics, constantly logging their health data, and report any abnormalities to the relevant healthcare provider. However, it is crucial to preserve the privacy of patients while utilizing this model so as to maintain their satisfaction and trust in the offered services. With the increasing number of cases for privacy breaches of healthcare data, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define the best practices for the protection of personal health information. The health insurance portability and accountability act and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing the cloud-based healthcare services to generate accurate health insights are feasible, while preserving the privacy of the end-users&#x2019; sensitive health information, which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own personal gateway. To support this claim, the personal gateways at the end-users&#x2019; side will act as intermediate nodes (called fog nodes) between the IoHT devices and the cloud-based healthcare services. In such solution, these fog nodes will host a holistic privacy middleware that executes a two-stage concealment process within a distributed data collection protocol that utilizes the hierarchical nature of the IoHT devices. This will unburden the constrained IoHT devices from performing intensive privacy preserving processes. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional way&#x2014;which is OECD privacy principles. We depicted how the proposed approach can be integrated into a scenario related to preserving the privacy of the users&#x2019; health data that is utilized by a cloud-based healthcare recommender service in order to generate accurate referrals. Our holistic approach induces a straightforward solution with accurate results, which are beneficial to both end-users and service providers.",

abstract = "Advancements in smart devices, wearable gadgets, sensors, and communication paradigm have enabled the vision of smart cities, pervasive healthcare, augmented reality and interactive multimedia, Internet of Every Thing (IoE), and cognitive assistance, to name a few. All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.",

The potentiostat communicates wirelessly with mobile devices such as tablets or Smartphones by near-field communication (NFC) or with personal computers by radio-frequency identification (RFID), and thus provides a solution to the 'missing link' in connectivity that often exists between low-cost mobile and wearable chemical sensors and ubiquitous mobile computing products. The mobile potentiostat has been evaluated in the laboratory with a set of proof-of-concept experiments, and its analytical performance compared with a commercial laboratory potentiostat (R.sup.2=0.9999). These first experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the wireless potentiostat and suggest that the device could be suitable for wearable and point-of-sample analytical measurements. We conclude that the wireless potentiostat could contribute significantly to the advancement of mobile chemical sensor research and adoption, in particular for wearable sensors in healthcare and sport physiology, for wound monitoring and in mobile point-of-sample diagnostics as well as more generally as a part of the Sensor Internet of Things.

The exploitation of the Internet protocol version 6 addressing space along with the miniaturization of electronic devices has fostered providing interoperability and connectivity of wearable sensor devices in wireless body area networks to the Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose to integrate the IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) to the u‐healthcare monitoring system architecture. The main objective is to study the feasibility of the 6LoWPAN‐enabled platform in real‐world scenarios dealing with medical data. The performance evaluation of this platform is carried out initially through simulations using OMNet++ and then supported by an experimental study using sensor motes and a customized micro‐computing unit. Performance metrics such as throughput, end‐to‐end delay, packet error rate, and energy consumption are investigated under acute health conditions, where patient's health information has to be sent continuously and at maximum rate to the care provider.

Cognitive radio is able to exploit spectrum opportunities and increase the communication performance for the e-healthcare system. To access the spectrum safely, the security aspect of spectrum utilization should be carefully addressed. A well-known threat to the spectrum utilization is the primary user emulation attack (PUEA) in which the attackers emulate as the primary users to obtain spectrum opportunities. To defend this threat, in this paper, we propose a triple threshold energy detection (TTED) to identify the PUEA. Based on the TTED, legitimate devices are allowed to access the available channels when the licensed channel is idle or occupied by attackers. To evaluate our proposed access scheme, we derive the achievable throughput while the average transmission time is fixed and exponential distributed, respectively.

However, a challenge faced by healthcare industry is the limited adoption and use of RFID by physicians and nurses. This research extended existing work by integrating unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence) and individual differences, namely personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness and extraversion) and demographic characteristics (i.e. age and gender) to predict the adoption of RFID in the healthcare supply chain. Data was collected from 252 physicians and nurses. The research model was tested by employing neural network analysis. During the course of this research, 11 variables were proposed in a bid to predict the adoption of RFID by physicians and nurses. In general, individual differences are able to predict the adoption of RFID better compared to variables derived from UTAUT. This study contributes to the growing interest in understanding the acceptance of RFID in the healthcare industry.

In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers (HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation. The detailed security analysis as well as the extensive simulations on a large data set with millions of records demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed system for real world healthcare applications.",

We propose a universal model for bias-stress (BS)-induced instability in the inkjet-printed carbon nanotube (CNT) networks used in field-effect transistors (FETs). By combining two experimental methods, i.e., a comparison between air and vacuum BS tests and interface trap extraction, BS instability is explained regardless of either the BS polarity or ambient condition, using a single platform constituted by four key factors: OH− adsorption/desorption followed by a change in carrier concentration, electron concentration in CNT channel corroborated with H2O/O2 molecules in ambient, charge trapping/detrapping, and interface trap generation. Under negative BS (NBS), the negative threshold voltage shift (ΔVT) is dominated by OH− desorption, which is followed by hole trapping in the interface and/or gate insulator. Under positive BS (PBS), the positive ΔVT is dominated by OH− adsorption, which is followed by electron trapping in the interface and/or gate insulator. This instability is compensated by interface trap extraction; PBS instability is slightly more complicated than NBS instability. Furthermore, our model is verified using device simulation, which gives insights on how much each mechanism contributes to BS instability. Our result is potentially useful for the design of highly stable CNT-based flexible circuits in the Internet of Things wearable healthcare era.",

These cyber-physical systems (CPSs) not only lead to the accumulation of large amounts of data that can be used to build comprehensive mathematical models, but also raise the quest for real-time analysis and control in diverse application domains, such as environment, healthcare, avionics, smart interconnected automobiles, and smart buildings. Endowing the CPS with a higher degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data requires efficient control modules.

Toward this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient NoC-based multicore architecture capable of solving large-scale nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems.

The reasons for such a change have been ease of timely diagnosis, convenience and comfort of clinical treatments. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are mainly characterized by deployment of biomedical sensors around human body which transmit vital signs measurements about the health status of the patient. Unfortunately, the huge traffic load of clinical data and limited resources of biomedical sensors make the efficiency of long-term operations almost impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to make significant advances in sensor's energy saving. Our idea is to reduce the activities of some sensors depending on the relevance between the data they measure and the diseases to detect. This paper shows how to extend the lifetime of medical WBANs by appropriately taking benefit of correlation between the knowledge about the disease and sensing data to drive the best scheduling of the medical sensors. For that, the theoretical framework of an economic approach, i.e., network utility maximization, is developed for sensor scheduling under operations cost constraint. It is shown that the compact subset of sensors can be found to provide necessary information for timely and correct diagnoses. Based on the theoretical framework, an algorithm combining sensor selection and information gain is then proposed. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves high performance in terms of energy saving vs latency in disease detection.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

For instance, long-term monitoring of brain activities using wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors is widely exploited in the clinical diagnosis of epileptic seizures and sleeping disorders. However, the deployment of such platforms is challenged by the high power consumption and system complexity. Energy efficiency can be achieved by exploring efficient compression techniques such as compressive sensing (CS). CS is an emerging theory that enables a compressed acquisition using well-designed sensing matrices. Moreover, system complexity can be optimized by using hardware friendly structured sensing matrices. This paper quantifies the performance of a CS-based multichannel EEG monitoring. In addition, the paper exploits the joint sparsity of multichannel EEG using subspace pursuit (SP) algorithm as well as a designed sparsifying basis in order to improve the reconstruction quality. Furthermore, the paper proposes a modification to the SP algorithm based on an adaptive selection approach to further improve the performance in terms of reconstruction quality, execution time, and the robustness of the recovery process.",

By synthesis of functional abstraction for configuration management and performance monitoring, an approach to design RESTful web services for mobile monitoring is suggested. In addition to traditional operations supported by Database Management Systems, web services' operations for subscription management and notifications about occurrences of specific data-related events, as well as operations for trust and security management are proposed in the context of third party's database access. Web services deployment issues concern the access control aimed to prevent from overloading. A formal method for a model-based load evaluation of SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) application server is suggested. The method takes into account the distributed server architecture and the processing of heterogeneous traffic. The SOA application server's utilization is evaluated by simulation.",

abstract = "Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources. The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94&#x0025; &#x00B1; 0.1, and that is for running speech is 99.75&#x0025; &#x00B1; 0.8.",

Digital data and connected worlds of physical objects, people, and devices are rapidly changing the way we work, travel, socialize, and interact with our surroundings, and they have a profound impact on different domains, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, urban systems, and control and management applications, among several other areas. Cities currently face an increasing demand for providing services that can have an impact on people's everyday lives. The CityPulse framework supports smart city service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams. To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection, quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates how they interact to support easy development of custom-made applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation presented in this paper.",

Therefore, it is expected that IoT will play a significant role in the next-generation healthcare provisioning. Although IoT-based patient health status monitoring has become very popular, monitoring patients remotely outside of hospital settings requires augmenting the capabilities of IoT with other resources for health data storage and processing. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based service-oriented framework for continuous patient health status monitoring framework that connects WBAN through smartphones to cloud computing. We theoretically model the proposed framework, which is the first attempt in this direction, and study the behaviour of the proposed IoT–WBANs-based framework. Experimental evaluation based on the sensor lifetime, existing cost and energy consumption shows that the proposed framework substantially outperforms the baseline WBANs.",

Antoniou, Giorgos Bamparopoulos, Panagiotis D. Bamidis Abstract: Elderly support ambient assisted living environments are focal in healthcare computing. Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naive, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers' data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework's architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the USEFIL project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework's design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.

In order to encourage IoT market participation, reliable evidence guaranteeing market success needs to be presented to investors and enterprises. Particularly, the most promising domain in IoT needs to be discovered as a killer application to primarily invest in and develop, so that it can pioneer the IoT market. This study proposes an AHP model for assessing the viability of IoT applications, which consists of 11 technology, market, and regulation factors. The model was applied to assess and compare the prospect of three IoT applications - i.e. IoT healthcare, IoT logistics, and IoT energy management, inviting the perception of 31 ICT experts. The results showed that IoT logistics is the most promising IoT application, due to its strong market potential. IoT healthcare is perceived to have strength in wide consumer market demand, but reliability issues and regulation issues were posed. Meanwhile, IoT energy management showed strengths only in governmental support. The results also imply that it would be wiser for the government to focus on eliminating regulatory bottlenecks.",

abstract = "Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.",

Numerous applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have appeared in various fields, from environmental monitoring, to tactical fields, and healthcare at home, promising to change our quality of life and facilitating the vision of sensor network enabled smart cities. Given the enormous requirements that emerge in such a setting—both in terms of data and energy—data aggregation appears as a key element in reducing the amount of traffic in wireless sensor networks and achieving energy conservation. Probabilistic frameworks have been introduced as operational efficient and performance effective solutions for data aggregation in distributed sensor networks. In this work, we introduce an overall optimization approach that improves and complements such frameworks towards identifying the optimal probability for a node to aggregate packets as well as the optimal aggregation period that a node should wait for performing aggregation, so as to minimize the overall energy consumption, while satisfying certain imposed delay constraints. Primal dual decomposition is employed to solve the corresponding optimization problem while simulation results demonstrate the operational efficiency of the proposed approach under different traffic and topology scenarios.</p>",

abstract = "Sensor networks for healthcare IoT (Internet of Things) have advanced rapidly in recent years, which has made it possible to integrate real-time health data by connecting bodies and sensors. Body sensors require accurate time synchronization in order to collaboratively monitor health conditions and medication usage. Self-recovery and high accuracy are crucial for time synchronization protocols in sensor networks for healthcare IoT. Because body sensors are generally deployed with unstable energy sources, nodes can fail because of inadequate power supply. This influences the efficiency and robustness of time synchronization protocols. Tree-based protocols require stable root nodes as time references. The time synchronization process cannot be completed if a root node fails. To address this problem, we present a Self-Recoverable Time Synchronization (SRTS) scheme for healthcare IoT sensor networks. A recovery timer is set up for candidate nodes, which are dynamically elected. The candidate node whose timer expires first takes charge of selecting a new root node. Meanwhile, SRTS combines the two-points least-squares method and the MAC layer timestamp to significantly improve the accuracy of PBS. Furthermore, SRP and RRP models are used in SRTS. Thus, our approach provides higher accuracy than PBS, while consuming a similar amount of energy. We use NS2 network tools to evaluate our approach. The simulation results show that SRTS exhibits better self-recovery than time synchronization protocols STETS and GPA under different network scales. Moreover, accuracy and clock drift compensation are better than those of PBS and TPSN.",

Due to their life- or mission-critical nature, these systems need to provide a high level of availability and accuracy. On the one hand, centralized cloud-based IoT systems lack reliability, punctuality and availability (e.g., in case of slow or unreliable Internet connection), and on the other hand, fully outsourcing data analytics to the edge of the network can result in diminished level of accuracy and adaptability due to the limited computational capacity in edge nodes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing a hierarchical computing architecture, HiCH, for IoT-based health monitoring systems. The core components of the proposed system are 1) a novel computing architecture suitable for hierarchical partitioning and execution of machine learning based data analytics, 2) a closed-loop management technique capable of autonomous system adjustments with respect to patient's condition. HiCH benefits from the features offered by both fog and cloud computing and introduces a tailored management methodology for healthcare IoT systems.

abstract = "In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving e-health system, which is a fusion of Internet-of-things (IoT), big data and cloud storage. The medical IoT network monitors patient’s physiological data, which are aggregated to electronic health record (EHR). The medical big data that contains a large amount of EHRs are outsourced to cloud platform. In the proposed system, the patient distributes an IoT group key to the medical nodes in an authenticated way without interaction round. The IoT messages are encrypted using the IoT group key and transmitted to the patient, which can be batch authenticated by the patient. The encrypted EHRs are shared among patient and different data users in a fine-grained access control manner. A novel keyword match based policy update mechanism is designed to enable flexible access policy updating without privacy leakage. Extensive comparison and simulation results demonstrate that the algorithms in the proposed system are efficient. Comprehensive analysis is provided to prove its security. •Anonymity and traceability of patient and medical node: In this system, anonymous identities are assigned for both patient and medical nodes, which is calculated from their real identities. If an anonymous patient is found dishonest or misbehaving, the trusted authority is capable to trace his real identity. If an anonymous medical node is compromised and utilized to launch attack in patient’s IoT network, the patient can also recover the node’s real identity.•Authenticated IoT key distribution: In order to guarantee the confidentiality of the messages transmitted in the health IoT network, the patient generates a symmetric key and sends it to all the medical nodes (in patient’s IoT network) in a privacy-preserving way. A key extraction auxiliary message is created by the patient to encapsulate the IoT key. Receiving the message, the medical nodes authenticate that whether the auxiliary message is indeed sent by the patient to prevent impersonation attack.•Authenticated IoT ciphertext transmission: After the IoT key is extracted by the medical nodes, the generated IoT messages are encrypted by the key and sends to the patient. To ensure the reliability of the source, the patient authenticates the IoT ciphertext and then decrypt it. A large amount of IoT ciphertexts may arrive at the same time period, our system also provides a batch verification algorithm to improve the efficiency.•Lightweight fine-grained access control: The e-health big data are encrypted and stored in a cloud platform. To prevent unauthorized data access, our system designs an expressive and lightweight fine-grained access control mechanism. The patient controls the electronic health record (EHR) encryption procedure, and defines an access policy such that the data users with specific attributes can decrypt patient’s medical files. The algorithms in the access control mechanism are lightweight constructions.•Flexible subset keyword match based access policy update: We design a novel access policy update mechanism based on keyword match. When the patient wants to change the access policy, he does not need to download all his EHR ciphertexts, decrypt them and re-encrypt them with a new access policy. In our system, the patient generates a privacy-preserving policy update query, which is sent to the cloud server. Then, the cloud server updates the match files without knowing the plaintext. A highlight is that the policy update process is keyword match based. If the patient wants to update the access policy of the EHRs that contains certain keywords, the query keywords are embedded in the policy update query. Only the access policy match files that contains these query keywords as subset keywords will be updated.",

Mobile sensing technology and health systems responsive to individual profiles combined with cloud computing can expand innovation for new types of interoperable services that are consumer-oriented and community-based. This could fuel a paradigm shift in the way health care can be, or should be, provided and received, while lessening the burden on exhausted health and social care systems. Objective: Our goal is to identify and discuss the main scientific and engineering challenges that need to be successfully addressed in delivering state-of-the-art, ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth services, including citizen-centered wellness management services, and reposition their role and potential within a broader context of diverse sociotechnical drivers, agents, and stakeholders. Methods: We review the state-of-the-art relevant to the development and implementation of eHealth and mHealth services in critical domains. We identify and discuss scientific, engineering, and implementation-related challenges that need to be overcome to move research, development, and the market forward. Results: Several important advances have been identified in the fields of systems for personalized health monitoring, such as smartphone platforms and intelligent ubiquitous services. Sensors embedded in smartphones and clothes are making the unobtrusive recognition of physical activity, behavior, and lifestyle possible, and thus the deployment of platforms for health assistance and citizen empowerment. Similarly, significant advances are observed in the domain of infrastructure supporting services. Still, many technical problems remain to be solved, combined with no less challenging issues related to security, privacy, trust, and organizational dynamics. Conclusions: Delivering innovative ubiquitous eHealth and mHealth services, including citizen-centered wellness and lifestyle management services, goes well beyond the development of technical solutions. For the large-scale information and communication technology-supported adoption of healthier lifestyles to take place, crucial innovations are needed in the process of making and deploying usable empowering end-user services that are trusted and user-acceptable.

In the cluster formation stage, we design an energy-saving clustering routing algorithm based on the node degree, the relative distance between nodes, and the rest energy of nodes. When this algorithm selects the cluster head, the node degree and the relative distance between the nodes are fully considered, so the selected cluster not only has better coverage performance but also short average distance from other member nodes in the formative cluster; therefore, the cost of communications within the clusters is small. In the stable data transfer stage, by using bee colony optimization (BCO), we design a PECE strategy for data transmission. On the basis of considering the predictive values of energy consumption, the hops, and the propagation delay on this route, this strategy gives a precise definition of the route yield by using two types of bee agent to predict the route yield of each routing path from the source node to the sink node. Through the optimization design of the algorithm, it can improve the quality of clusters, thereby increasing the overall network performance, and reduces and balances the energy consumption of whole network and prolongs the survival time of the network.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) networks are the pillar of recent novel scenarios, such as smart cities or e-healthcare applications. Among other challenges, these networks cover the deployment and interaction of small devices with constrained capabilities and Internet protocol (IP)-based networking connectivity. These constrained devices usually require connection to the Internet to exchange information (e.g., management or sensing data) or access network services. However, only authenticated and authorized devices can, in general, establish this connection. The so-called authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) services are in charge of performing these tasks on the Internet. Thus, it is necessary to deploy protocols that allow constrained devices to verify their credentials against AAA infrastructures. The Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) has been standardized by the Internet engineering task force (IETF) to carry the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which provides flexible authentication upon the presence of AAA. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first deep study of the feasibility of EAP/PANA for network access control in constrained devices. We provide light-weight versions and implementations of these protocols to fit them into constrained devices. These versions have been designed to reduce the impact in standard specifications. The goal of this work is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of EAP/PANA in IoT devices; (2) to provide the scientific community with the first light-weight interoperable implementation of EAP/PANA for constrained devices in the Contiki operating system (Contiki OS), called PANATIKI. The paper also shows a testbed, simulations and experimental results obtained from real and simulated constrained devices.",

In this paper, we propose a reliable oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Devices. In order to use a Personal Healthcare Device as an Application Dedicated Node in the proposed system, a protocol conversion between ISO/IEEE 11073 protocol messages and oneM2M protocol messages is performed in gateways located between Personal Healthcare Devices and the PHD management server. The proposed oneM2M-based IoT system for Personal Healthcare Device is constructed, and evaluated in various experiments. The experiments show that the protocol conversion performs effectively, and that the conversion process does not cause the system to suffer serious performance degradation, even when the number of Application Dedicated Node is quite large. Some Personal Healthcare Device data is too precious to lose due to system failures under u-healthcare environments. However, until now, few studies have focused on fault-tolerant health data services. Therefore, we also propose a fault-tolerant algorithm for the reliable IoT system in which gateways on the same layer in the system are linked to form a daisy chain for fault tolerance at the level, and a gateway stores the backup copy of the previous gateway positioned immediately ahead of the gateway in the daisy chain. The upper-layered gateway stores the parity data of the daisy chain as well. In this manner, as many as two gateway faults occurred at the same time can be recovered. For experiments, the resource trees of the oneM2M-based IoT system were expanded to store information on daisy chains, backup copies, and parity. Our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can recover from faults on gateways in the oneM2M-based IoT system.

It's becoming more and more apparent that businesses are at risk of disintermediation from lack of understanding of data. Whoever harnesses the data controls the industry. Yet adding a radically diferent new capability to a well-established business is not easy. Even the most sophisticated well-established companies are running into many obstacles. Software is diferent. Software engineers have a loyalty to the software, not to the company they work for or the markets in which the software is used. With companies such as Google and Facebook setting the benchmark, employees expect to be treated diferently, with a fexible working environment and fast-rising stock options. This model does not ft the way the aerospace majors work, and so it's not surprising that key talent often walks out the door soon after an acquisition. The parent company's shareholders, in general, are interested in short-term performance. Persuading shareholders of an aerospace company to make a longterm bet on a loss-making software company on a multiple of fve or six times sales is not easy, but this level of multiple is commonplace in the high-tech world. What is more, software companies are usually at such an early stage that no one really knows where the technology will deliver the most business value. For example, one engine company invested in analytical software to predict engine problems only to fnd that the biggest market for this software was in healthcare.",

abstract = "Internet of Things (IoT) applications in several domains such as surveillance of civil infrastructure, smart grids, and smart healthcare are of utmost importance for our society and require dependable performance. Guaranteeing that application-specific dependability requirements are met is however still an open research challenge. The IoT indeed exposes highly resource-constrained computing devices to harsh environmental conditions (e.g., heat, mechanical shock, electromagnetic radiation) and physical attacks. Unfortunately, traditional methods to withstand these threats heavily rely on redundancy, a concept that is incompatible with the resource constraints of common IoT devices. In this article, we illustrate our efforts in providing methods and tools to predict, guarantee, and raise the level of dependability of the IoT. We first outline our contributions in the area of dependable wireless networking and describe a cost-effective solution allowing to guarantee that IoT applications meet specific performance requirements despite the challenging interaction of low-power wireless networks with their surrounding environment. We then argue that dependable networking alone is insufficient to guarantee the correct operation of a complex IoT system, and outline how we join different scientific disciplines in a long-term endeavor and work towards a coherent view of dependability. Die Anwendungen des Internets der Dinge (IoT – Internet of Things), wie z. B. die Überwachung von zivilen Infrastruktureinrichtungen, Smart Grids oder intelligente Gesundheitspflege, sind für unsere Gesellschaft von größter Bedeutung und erfordern eine hohe Verlässlichkeit des IoT. Die je nach Gebiet unterschiedlichen Anforderungen an die Zuverlässigkeit zu gewährleisten, stellt jedoch immer noch eine große Herausforderung für die Wissenschaft dar. Tatsächlich sind die eingesetzten Geräte und Computer rauen Umgebungsbedingungen (wie z. B. Hitze oder elektromagnetische Strahlung) sowie physischen Angriffen ausgesetzt. Herkömmliche Methoden diesen Bedrohungen stand zu halten, beruhen meist auf Redundanzen – einem Konzept, das mit den beschränkten Ressourcen gängiger IoT-Plattformen nicht umsetzbar ist. Im vorliegenden Beitrag zeigen die Autoren Methoden und Werkzeuge auf, um die Zuverlässigkeit des IoT zu erhöhen, besser vorhersagbar zu machen und letztlich Verlässlichkeitsgarantien abzugeben. Sie berichten zunächst über Erfahrungen im Bereich der zuverlässigen drahtlosen Vernetzung und beschreiben eine effiziente Lösung, um auch in anspruchsvollen Umgebungen mit ressourcenarmen IoT-Plattformen verlässlich kommunizieren zu können. Um ein verlässliches IoT zu konstruieren, genügt die alleinige Betrachtung der drahtlosen Vernetzung jedoch nicht. Die Autoren beschreiben daher einen ganzheitlichen interdisziplinären Ansatz, um alle relevanten Aspekte des IoT verlässlich zu gestalten.",

Adoption of Internet of Things is still limited to a few application areas. In developing countries, the usefulness of IOT's adoption is recognized as a key factor for economic and social development of a country by both academicians and practitioners as well. Currently, there are still very few studies that explore the adoption of Internet of Things from a multiple theory perspective, namely, The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This research aims to satisfy a clear gap in the main field of research by proposing a Structured Equation Model (SEM) approach to test three competing models in the context of Internet of Things in India. With respect to previous literature, this research sets the stage for extensive research in a broad domain of application areas for the Internet of Things, like healthcare, elderly well- being and support, smart cities and smart supply chains etc. •The study takes the Structured Equation Modeling approach to test competing models.•TRA, TPB and TAM form the basis of our study.•The research has implications for healthcare monitoring, and elderly support.•The three models are unable to explain the adoption of IOT in India.•There are some other factors in the specific context of IOT need to be explored.",

abstract = "  The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging key technology for future industries and everyday lives of people, where a myriad of battery operated sensors, actuators, and smart objects are connected to the Internet to provide services such as mobile healthcare, intelligent transport system, environmental monitoring, etc. Since energy efficiency is of utmost importance to these battery constrained IoT devices, IoT-related standards and research works have focused on the device energy conserving issues. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on energy conserving issues and solutions in using diverse wireless radio access technologies for IoT connectivity, e.g., the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) machine type communications, IEEE 802.11ah, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Z-Wave. We look into the literature in broad areas of standardization, academic research, and industry development, and structurally summarize the energy conserving solutions based on several technical criteria. We also propose future research directions regarding energy conserving issues in wireless networking-based IoT.",
